/**
 * TIP:
 * When nesting elements inside a parent component with rounded corners, you need to adjust their border radius
 * to match the parent's curvature. To calculate the correct border radius for nested elements:
 * 1. Take the parent's border radius
 * 2. Subtract half of the horizontal padding used in the nested element
 * This ensures nested elements flow smoothly with the parent's rounded corners.
