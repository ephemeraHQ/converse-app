# Architectural Refactoring Plan: Group Joining Feature

## Project Overview
This document outlines the plan for refactoring the 
group joining feature in our mobile application. The 
goal is to introduce new architectural patterns to 
improve testability, consistency, and maintainability of the codebase.

## Motivation
- Improve testability of the group joining feature
- Implement consistent patterns for feature development
- Adapt patterns from the Composable Architecture to 
  JavaScript/React Native (already built by Michael)
- Separate business logic from UI, making UI a side effect of business logic
- Address existing bugs in the group joining process
- Provide better ways for non-programming stakeholders 
  to understand and find bugs in the business logic

## Timeline
**Duration**: 2-4 weeks
**Start Date**: October 1, 2024
**End Date**: mid-late October  2024 (tentative, 
before Michael paternity leave)

### Week 1 (October 1 - October 4)
- **October 1-2**: 
  - Set up project structure
  - Begin implementation of dependency control pattern
  - Start designing state machine for group joining logic
- **October 3-4**: Off

### Week 2 (October 7 - October 11)
- Implement core state machine for group joining
- Develop event-driven testing framework
- Begin integration with existing Zustand and React Query logic

### Week 3 (October 14 - October 18)
- Complete integration with Zustand and React Query
- Implement key behavioral flows and edge cases
- Conduct thorough testing and bug fixing

### Week 4 (Optional, October 21 - October 25)
- Finalize documentation
- Conduct code reviews
- Prepare for integration into main codebase

## Key Deliverables
1. State machine representing group joining logic
2. Complete test coverage for key behavioral flows
3. Dependency control pattern implementation
4. Event-driven testing framework
5. Integration with Zustand and React Query
6. Documentation of new architecture and patterns

## Detailed Tasks

### 1. State Machine Implementation
- Design state diagram for group joining process
- Implement state transitions and actions
- Handle edge cases (e.g., already accepted invites, booted users)

### 2. Dependency Control Pattern
- Create global singleton for dependency clients
- Implement different flavors of dependency implementations
- Develop mechanism for switching implementations at build/run time

### 3. Event-Driven Testing
- Set up testing framework for event-driven architecture
- Implement tests for key behavioral flows
- Ensure high test coverage for critical paths

### 4. Zustand and React Query Integration
- Analyze current usage of Zustand for shared state
- Study React Query implementation for API logic
- Develop strategy for consuming these libraries imperatively
- Implement GroupInviteClient with various endpoints

### 5. Key Behavioral Flows
- New user joining a new group (happy path)
- User attempting to join an already accepted invite
- Handling booted users attempting to rejoin
- Other edge cases as identified during development

### 6. Documentation and Knowledge Sharing
- Document new architectural patterns
- Create examples and guidelines for future feature development
- Prepare presentation materials for team knowledge sharing

## Checkpoints and Demonstrations
- **October 11**: Demo of initial state machine and dependency control pattern
- **October 18**: Presentation of completed group joining feature with new architecture

## Risks and Mitigations
- Learning curve for imperative usage of Zustand and React Query
  - Mitigation: Allocate extra time for research and experimentation
- Potential conflicts with existing architecture
  - Mitigation: Regular check-ins with team leads (Alex, Tierry, Saul) for alignment
- Time constraints due to upcoming paternity leave
  - Mitigation: Prioritize core functionality and documentation; prepare for potential handoff

## Next Steps
1. Review and refine this plan with team leads
2. Set up project structure and initial repository
3. Begin implementation of core components (state machine, dependency control)
