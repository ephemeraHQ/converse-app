 * the underlying implementation, allowing developers to
 * change the functionality easily as needed.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * // In production
 * const networkMonitor = NetworkMonitorClient.live();
 *
 * // In tests
 * const networkMonitor = NetworkMonitorClient.satisfied();
 *
 * Subscribers can subscribe to network state changes without
 * worrying about the underlying implementation.

 *
 * This class supports different implementations for various

 * and custom behaviors. By abstracting the underlying
 * implementation, subscribers can remain agnostic to how the
 * network state is provided.
 *
 * The network state can be dynamically controlled at runtime,
 * which is useful for testing or simulating network conditions.
 *
 * This class uses the singleton pattern to ensure that only
 * one instance of NetworkMonitorClient exists throughout the
 * application. This is important because it maintains a single
 * source of truth for the network state and allows for consistent
 * behavior across different parts of the application.
