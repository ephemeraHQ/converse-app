## Fixing TypeScript Typing for Message IDs (1/17/2025, 8:49:08 AM)

why doing this fuck the typing of newbyId?

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, I understand the issue. The problem occurs because `realMessage.id` is being used as a key in the object, but TypeScript is having trouble with the type consistency between `MessageId` and the object key type.

Let's fix the typing by being explicit about the `MessageId` type:

```typescript:queries/use-conversation-messages-query.ts
// ... existing code ...
        [realMessage.id as MessageId]: updateObjectAndMethods(realMessage, {
          tempOptimisticId: tempId,
        }),
// ... existing code ...
```

The issue was that we needed to explicitly tell TypeScript that `realMessage.id` is of type `MessageId` when using it as an object key. This ensures type consistency with the `Record<MessageId, DecodedMessageWithCodecsType>` type that `byId` expects.

We can also remove the `@ts-expect-error` comment since adding `tempOptimisticId` to the message object is an intentional extension of the type. If you want to be more type-safe, you could create a new interface that extends `DecodedMessageWithCodecsType` to include the optional `tempOptimisticId` property.

as MessageId doesn'T help

Ah, I see. The issue is likely because `updateObjectAndMethods` is returning a modified object that doesn't strictly match the `DecodedMessageWithCodecsType` type (since we're adding `tempOptimisticId`). Let's fix this by properly typing the return value:

```typescript:queries/use-conversation-messages-query.ts
// ... existing code ...
type MessageWithOptimisticId = DecodedMessageWithCodecsType & {
  tempOptimisticId?: string;
};

// ... existing code ...
        [realMessage.id as MessageId]: updateObjectAndMethods(realMessage, {
          tempOptimisticId: tempId,
        }) as MessageWithOptimisticId,
// ... existing code ...
```

This should resolve the typing issue by:
1. Creating a new type that extends `DecodedMessageWithCodecsType` to include the optional `tempOptimisticId`
2. Using a type assertion to tell TypeScript that the modified object matches our extended type

The typing error was occurring because we were trying to add a property that wasn't part of the original type definition, and TypeScript was correctly warning us about this inconsistency.

even doing that doens'T work

Ah, now I see the issue. The problem is with the object literal type inference. Let's explicitly type `newById` to match the type expected in the accumulator:

```typescript:queries/use-conversation-messages-query.ts
// ... existing code ...
      const newById: Record<MessageId, DecodedMessageWithCodecsType> = {
        [realMessage.id as MessageId]: realMessage,
        ...previousMessages.byId,
      };
// ... existing code ...
```

This explicitly tells TypeScript that we're creating a record with `MessageId` keys and `DecodedMessageWithCodecsType` values. The issue was that TypeScript was inferring the type from the object literal syntax and having trouble reconciling the types when spreading `previousMessages.byId`.
