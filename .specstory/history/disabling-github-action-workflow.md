I'll help you disable this GitHub Action. There are two common ways to do this:

1. The simplest way is to rename the file by adding `.disabled` to the end
2. Or you can add a condition to skip all steps

Here's how to implement the second approach with minimal changes:

```yaml:.github/workflows/check-ios-build.yml
name: Check iOS Build

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - "ios/**"
      - "package.json"
      - "yarn.lock"
      - "app.config.ts"

jobs:
  build:
    # Add if: false to disable the entire workflow
    if: false
    runs-on: warp-ubuntu-latest-x64-8x
    steps:
      // ... existing code ...
```

You have two options:

1. **Rename the file** (Recommended):
   - Simply rename `.github/workflows/check-ios-build.yml` to `.github/workflows/check-ios-build.yml.disabled`
   - This completely prevents GitHub from detecting and running the workflow

2. **Add the condition** (Shown in the code above):
   - Add `if: false` under the `build` job
   - This keeps the file in place but makes the workflow skip all steps

The first option (renaming) is generally preferred as it's more explicit and doesn't consume any GitHub Actions minutes at all.

if i add .disabled it won'T get recognized by github right?

_**Assistant**_

Correct! When you add `.disabled` to the filename, GitHub Actions will completely ignore the file. It won't recognize or try to execute it at all.

So renaming from:
`.github/workflows/check-ios-build.yml`

to:
`.github/workflows/check-ios-build.yml.disabled`

will effectively disable the workflow without deleting it. This is a common practice when you want to temporarily disable a workflow while keeping the configuration for future use. When you want to re-enable it, you can simply remove the `.disabled` suffix.
