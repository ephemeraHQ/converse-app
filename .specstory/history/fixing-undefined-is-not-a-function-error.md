i get an error "undefined is not a function" here why?

_**Assistant**_

The error "undefined is not a function" typically occurs when trying to call a method that doesn't exist. In this case, it's likely because `Promise.allSettled()` might not be available in your environment.

`Promise.allSettled()` was introduced in ES2020, so if your environment or TypeScript configuration doesn't support it, you'll need to either:

1. Add the necessary polyfill
2. Use `Promise.all()` instead (though this won't handle failures as gracefully)
3. Update your TypeScript configuration to target ES2020 or later

Here's how you can modify the code to use `Promise.all()` as a safer alternative:

```typescript:components/StateHandlers/HydrationStateHandler.tsx
// ... existing code ...
      try {
        const results = await Promise.all(
          accounts.map(async (account) => {
            try {
              await ensureInboxId({ account });
              return { status: "fulfilled", account };
            } catch (error) {
              return { status: "rejected", account, error };
            }
          })
        );

        // Remove accounts that failed to get an inboxId
        results.forEach((result) => {
          if (result.status === "rejected") {
            captureError({
              ...result.error,
              message: `[Hydration] Failed to get inboxId for account ${result.account}, removing account. ${result.error.message}`,
            });
            useAccountsStore.getState().removeAccount(result.account);
          }
        });
// ... existing code ...
```

This alternative approach:
1. Uses `Promise.all()` which has broader support
2. Manually handles the success/failure cases to mimic `allSettled` behavior
3. Maintains the same functionality as the original code

If you prefer to keep using `Promise.allSettled()`, you should check your `tsconfig.json` and ensure:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020" // or higher
  }
}
```
