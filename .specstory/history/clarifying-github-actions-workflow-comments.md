put comments above stuff I don't undersanda what is happening here

I'll add explanatory comments above the less obvious parts of the workflow. Here are the relevant sections with added comments:

```yaml:.github/workflows/create-new-release.yml
// ... existing code ...

      # This step gets all remote branches that start with 'release/',
      # strips the 'origin/release/' prefix, and sorts them by version number.
      # The result is saved to GITHUB_OUTPUT for use in later steps
      - name: Get All Release Branches
        id: release_branches
        run: |
          RELEASE_BRANCHES=$(git branch -r | grep 'origin/release/' | sed 's|origin/release/||' | sort -V)
          echo "RELEASE_BRANCHES<<EOF" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "$RELEASE_BRANCHES" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          echo "EOF" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      # This step takes the latest release branch version and increments the patch number
      # For example: if latest is 1.2.3, this will create 1.2.4
      # It splits the version number into major.minor.patch components using IFS
      - name: Determine Next Version
        id: next_version
        run: |
          LATEST_RELEASE_BRANCH=$(echo "${{ steps.release_branches.outputs.RELEASE_BRANCHES }}" | tail -n1)
          echo "Latest release branch: $LATEST_RELEASE_BRANCH"
          IFS='.' read -ra ADDR <<< "$LATEST_RELEASE_BRANCH"
          MAJOR=${ADDR[0]:-0}
          MINOR=${ADDR[1]:-0}
          PATCH=${ADDR[2]:-0}
          NEXT_PATCH=$((PATCH+1))
          NEXT_VERSION="$MAJOR.$MINOR.$NEXT_PATCH"
          echo "NEXT_VERSION=$NEXT_VERSION" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

// ... existing code ...

      # This step runs a Node.js script that updates the version number
      # in app.json and commits the change
      - name: Increment Version in package.json
        run: |
          node scripts/build/incrementVersion.js
          git add app.json
          git commit -m "Increment version to ${{ steps.next_version.outputs.NEXT_VERSION }}"

// ... existing code ...
```

The workflow is designed to automate the creation of new release branches with incremented version numbers. It:
1. Gets all existing release branches
2. Finds the latest version number
3. Increments the patch number to create a new version
4. Creates a new branch with the incremented version
5. Updates the version in app.json
6. Pushes the new release branch
