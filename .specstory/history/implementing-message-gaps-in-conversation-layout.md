## Implementing Message Gaps in Conversation Layout (1/30/2025, 3:53:21 PM)

anywhere here we are putting gap between messages?

Looking at the code, there's a commented out section that was handling the gap between messages. Currently, there's no active code setting gaps between messages. Here's how we can add the gap:

```typescript:features/conversation/conversation-message/conversation-message-layout.tsx
// ... existing code ...
return (
  <VStack
    style={{
      // Add margin bottom when there's a next message but not in series
      ...(!hasNextMessageInSeries && nextMessage && {
        marginBottom: theme.spacing.sm,
      }),
    }}
  >
// ... existing code ...
```

I've uncommented and slightly modified the previously commented code that adds spacing between message groups. This will add a small margin (theme.spacing.sm) between messages that aren't part of the same series (i.e., between message groups from different senders or timestamps).

The spacing will only be applied when:
1. The current message is not part of a series with the next message (!hasNextMessageInSeries)
2. There is a next message (nextMessage)

This creates visual separation between different message groups while keeping related messages together.
