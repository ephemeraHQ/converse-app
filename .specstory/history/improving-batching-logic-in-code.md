fix the batcher it's not good!!

I'll help improve the batching logic. The main issues with the current implementation are:
1. It doesn't properly handle the response mapping
2. The grouping by account could be simplified
3. The results flattening could lead to incorrect matches

Here's the improved version:

```typescript:queries/useConversationDataQuery.ts
// ... existing code ...

const batchedGetConversationTopicData = create({
  scheduler: windowScheduler(50),
  resolver: keyResolver((args: IArgs) => args.account),
  async batchFn(args: IArgs[]) {
    // Group by account using Object.groupBy (or reduce if not available)
    const accountGroups = args.reduce((groups, arg) => {
      groups[arg.account] = groups[arg.account] || [];
      groups[arg.account].push(arg);
      return groups;
    }, {} as Record<string, IArgs[]>);

    // Process each account group and maintain mapping to original requests
    const results = await Promise.all(
      Object.entries(accountGroups).map(async ([account, groupArgs]) => {
        const topics = groupArgs.map(arg => arg.topic);
        const conversationsData = await getConversationsData({
          account,
          topics,
        });

        // Create a map of topic -> data for efficient lookup
        const topicDataMap = new Map(
          conversationsData.map(data => [data.topic, data])
        );

        // Map back to original requests while maintaining order
        return groupArgs.map(arg => topicDataMap.get(arg.topic.topic));
      })
    );

    // Flatten while preserving the mapping to original requests
    return results.flat();
  },
});

// ... existing code ...
```

Key improvements:
1. Uses a Map for efficient topic -> data lookup
2. Maintains proper ordering of results relative to input requests
3. More robust handling of the response mapping
4. Removed the unnecessary `find` operation which could be slow for large datasets
5. Better type safety by removing the force unwrap operator (`!`)

The batching now properly groups requests by account, fetches the data, and maps the results back to the original requests in the correct order. The use of `Map` also provides better performance for looking up results by topic.

still not good, the key resolve should have the topic no? the function is that we getConversationData and pass the topic and account to identify

Ah yes, you're absolutely right! The key resolver should include both the account AND topic to properly identify unique conversation data requests. Here's the fix:

```typescript:queries/useConversationDataQuery.ts
const batchedGetConversationTopicData = create({
  scheduler: windowScheduler(50),
  resolver: keyResolver((args: IArgs) => `${args.account}-${args.topic.topic}`),
  async batchFn(args: IArgs[]) {
    // Group by account using Object.groupBy (or reduce if not available)
    const accountGroups = args.reduce((groups, arg) => {
      groups[arg.account] = groups[arg.account] || [];
      groups[arg.account].push(arg);
      return groups;
    }, {} as Record<string, IArgs[]>);

    // Process each account group and maintain mapping to original requests
    const results = await Promise.all(
      Object.entries(accountGroups).map(async ([account, groupArgs]) => {
        const topics = groupArgs.map(arg => arg.topic);
        const conversationsData = await getConversationsData({
          account,
          topics,
        });

        // Create a map of topic -> data for efficient lookup
        const topicDataMap = new Map(
          conversationsData.map(data => [data.topic, data])
        );

        // Map back to original requests while maintaining order
        return groupArgs.map(arg => topicDataMap.get(arg.topic.topic));
      })
    );

    // Flatten while preserving the mapping to original requests
    return results.flat();
  },
});
```

The key change is in the resolver line, where we now create a unique key using both the account and topic:
```typescript
resolver: keyResolver((args: IArgs) => `${args.account}-${args.topic.topic}`)
```

This ensures that each unique combination of account and topic gets its own batch, which is correct since we're fetching conversation data that's specific to both the account and topic.
