I'll help modify the workflow to use a Personal Access Token (PAT) for the checkout action. Here's the necessary change:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml
name: Production Deployment

// ... existing code ...

      # Get the code from the repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT_GITHUB }}

// ... existing code ...
```

The change adds the `token` parameter to the checkout action, using the same `PAT_GITHUB` secret that's already being used in other parts of the workflow. This ensures that the checkout action has the necessary permissions and authentication to access the repository.

The PAT is important because it provides the necessary authentication for Git operations and ensures the workflow has sufficient permissions to perform actions like pushing commits back to the repository.
