_**Assistant**_

Let me explain the temporary merge strategy used in this deployment workflow:

The temporary merge is a safety mechanism that allows testing the deployment without permanently modifying the production branch. Here's how it works:

1. **Purpose**:
   - Creates a temporary state where we can test if the deployment will succeed
   - Allows for safe rollback if anything goes wrong
   - Prevents corrupting the production branch with failed deployments

2. **Process**:
```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml
# 1. Store current production state for potential rollback
echo "old_head=$(git rev-parse HEAD)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

# 2. Create temporary merge
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main --no-commit --no-ff
git commit -m "temp: Temporary merge for deployment verification"
```

3. **What happens next**:
   - The workflow continues with node setup, dependency installation, and either:
     - Building a new binary (if versions don't match)
     - Deploying an OTA update (if versions match)
   
4. **Outcomes**:
   - If successful (`if: success()`):
     - The temporary merge is made permanent with a proper commit message
     - Changes are pushed to production
   - If failed (`if: failure()`):
     - The production branch is reset to the stored `old_head`
     - Force pushed back to clean state
     - No permanent changes are made

This approach is particularly valuable because it:
- Provides a safe way to test deployments
- Maintains a clean production branch history
- Ensures atomic deployments (either fully succeeds or fully rolls back)
- Prevents partial or failed deployments from affecting production

I want ot adda comment explaining more so teamates can know why i'm doing this. But try to keep comments short

Here's the updated code with a concise but informative comment:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-prod.yml
// ... existing code ...

      # Create a temporary merge to test deployment safety. If deployment fails,
      # we can cleanly roll back without corrupting production branch history
      - name: Create temporary merge
        id: temp_merge
        run: |
          # Store the current production HEAD for potential rollback
          echo "old_head=$(git rev-parse HEAD)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          # Create temporary merge
          git fetch origin main
          git merge origin/main --no-commit --no-ff
          git config --global user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git config --global user.name "github-actions[bot]"
          git commit -m "temp: Temporary merge for deployment verification"

// ... existing code ...
```

The added comment succinctly explains both the what and why of the temporary merge strategy, making it easier for team members to understand the purpose of this step.
