## Organizing .cursorrules into Multiple .mdc Files (2/17/2025, 9:02:48 AM)

_**User**_

i created a new folder in .cursor/rules. In the foldeR I want you to create .mdc files . I don't like having a big @.cursorrules file with everything in it. I want many different files

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you break down the .cursorrules file into multiple .mdc files organized by category. I'll create these files in the .cursor/rules directory.

Here's how we can split them:

````markdown:.cursor/rules/core-principles.mdc
# Core Principles

- Write concise TypeScript code.
- Use functional programming patterns.
- Prefer clean, readable code over compact code, using empty lines to separate logical blocks and improve readability.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError). Doesn't mater if it's long. For example this is good: "useGroupMembersInfoForCurrentAccount".
- Prefer clean and easy to read code over compact code.
- Don't create function(s) inside other functions unless it's specified
- Add clear, concise comments to explain non-obvious logic or unconventional implementation decisions.
- When refactoring code, preserve existing comments unless explicitly instructed otherwise or the related code is removed. Comments often explain important context or implementation decisions that should be maintained.
- Comments should be above the code they are describing.
- Use the suffix 'ForCurrentAccount' when using useCurrentAccount inside components or hooks.
- Handle errors at the caller level. Unless if we really need to log something but make sure to throw back the error to the caller.
- Minimize using external hooks inside custom hooks to prevent unnecessary rerenders. Instead, use getter functions to access data, especially in mutations.
- Use Zod for external API response validation. Define zod schema and infer types from it.
- Keep files small and focused. Place hooks and components in separate files unless they are small wrapper components. This improves code organization and maintainability.
- Refactor a component using the composable pattern when you start seeing a lot of optional props.

## Logging
- Use logger for all logging operations:
- Prefer `logger.debug` over `console.log`
- Use template literals for inline logging:

```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Object-based logging
logger.debug("[buildXmtpClient] Starting to build XMTP client", {
  address,
  inboxId,
});

// ✅ Good: Inline template literal logging
logger.debug(
  `[buildXmtpClient] Starting to build XMTP client with address: ${address} and inboxId: ${inboxId}`
);
```
````

````markdown:.cursor/rules/typescript.mdc
# TypeScript Guidelines

- Use types over interfaces, prefixed with 'I' (e.g., IMyItem).
- Never use 'any'.
- Avoid enums, use maps instead.
- Use functional components with TypeScript types.
- Prefer inferring types if possible over explicit typing.
- Prefer type assertions on return objects (`return {...} satisfies IType`) over function return type annotations (`function(): IType`) if we have to put a type because the inferring is not working well.

## Function Patterns
- Use function keyword for pure functions.
- Prefer object params: `function(args: { name: string })` over `function(name: string)`.
- Destructure parameters at the top level.
  - Makes it clearer which properties are being used and
  - improves code readability.

```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Nested destructuring
function getMetadataOptions(args: IArgs) {
  const { account } = args;
}

// ✅ Good: Top-level destructuring
function getMetadataOptions({ account, topic }: IArgs) {
```
````

````markdown:.cursor/rules/react-components.mdc
# React & Components Guidelines

- Use named exports.
- Write JSX inline rather than separate render functions.
- Prefer early returns over ternaries.
- Use array syntax for merged styles: `style={[{ color: "red" }, style]}`.
- Minimize useEffect and setState usage.
- Wrap components in memo() for performance.
- When creating a new component or custom hook, aim to minimize the number of props you pass. Instead, try to reuse existing hooks whenever possible. This is especially important if the props or arguments you want to pass are only needed within the new component or hook we wanted to pass are ONLY used in the new component or hook.
- When asked to extract a component or some code for custom hooks, create those in the same file.
- Keep related code close together by placing the exported component at the top of the file with related components directly underneath it.
- Avoid default exports to maintain consistent imports and easier refactoring.
  - Named exports make codebase more maintainable and
  - refactoring safer.

```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Default export
export default function ProfileScreen()

// ✅ Good: Named export
export function ProfileScreen()
```
````

````markdown:.cursor/rules/file-structure.mdc
# File Structure & Naming

## Directory Structure
- Use lower-kebab-case for directories and files (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
- Import paths from our project should start with @/.
- Use the same name for the file and the component.
- Keep features self-contained. Create a new feature folder if accessing features across boundaries.
- Place queries within their respective feature folders, but maintain queryKeys at the root level for better visibility.

## File Naming Convention
Use descriptive suffixes:

```
[featureName].screen.tsx
[featureName].nav.tsx
[featureName].store.ts
[featureName].queries.ts
[featureName].utils.ts
[featureName].client.ts
[featureName].types.ts
[featureName].test.ts
```

// ❌ Bad: Generic or unclear names
profile.ts
group-chat.tsx
utils.ts
types.ts

// ✅ Good: Clear, descriptive names with proper suffixes
profile.screen.tsx
group-chat.nav.tsx
conversation.store.ts
messages.queries.ts
profile.utils.ts
auth.client.ts
user.types.ts
login.test.ts
````

````markdown:.cursor/rules/imports.mdc
# Import Guidelines

Always import using the @alias as examplified below:

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Using the @ to simplify imports
import { isConversationGroup } from "@/features/conversation/utils/is-conversation-group";
import { isConversationDm } from "@/features/conversation/utils/is-conversation-dm";
import { getReadableProfile } from "@/utils/getReadableProfile";
import { IConversationMembershipSearchResult } from "@/features/search/search.types";

// ❌ Bad: Using relative paths
import { isConversationGroup } from "../../../features/conversation/utils/is-conversation-group";
import { isConversationDm } from "../../../features/conversation/utils/is-conversation-dm";
import { getReadableProfile } from "../../../../utils/getReadableProfile";
import { IConversationMembershipSearchResult } from "../../../features/search/search.types";
```
````

````markdown:.cursor/rules/theming.mdc
# Theming & Styling

- Always use the theme for styling. Import it from @/theme/useAppTheme like `const { theme } = useAppTheme();`.
- Use components from @/design-system.
- Use the theme for colors and spacing.
````

````markdown:.cursor/rules/react-query.mdc
# React Query Guidelines

## Query Key Management
- All query keys must be defined in `QueryKeys.ts` using factory functions
- Follow naming pattern: `<entity>QueryKey` for key factories
- Use query key factory functions from `QueryKeys.ts` when accessing query keys

```typescript
// queries/QueryKeys.ts
export const conversationsQueryKey = (account: string) => [
  QueryKeys.CONVERSATIONS,
  account?.toLowerCase(),
];

// queries/use-conversations-query.ts
export const getConversationsQueryOptions = (args: IArgs) => ({
  queryKey: conversationsQueryKey(args.account),
  queryFn: () => getConversations(args),
  enabled: !!args.account
});
```

## Query Options Encapsulation
- Use React Query's `queryOptions` helper for type safety
- Export query options generators for cross-component usage
- Handle conditional fetching with `enabled` and `skipToken`
- Create an `enabled` variable before returning query options to avoid duplicating logic

## Implementation Principles
- Avoid destructuring rest operators with useQuery
- Use object parameters for query options

```typescript
// ❌ Bad: Causes unnecessary re-renders
const { data: conversations, ...rest } = useQuery()

// ✅ Good: Explicit property usage
const { data: conversations, isLoading, error } = useQuery()

// ❌ Bad: Positional arguments
useQuery(getConversationMessagesQueryOptions(account, topic))

// ✅ Good: Object parameters
useQuery(getConversationMessagesQueryOptions({ account, topic }))
```
````

````markdown:.cursor/rules/mutations.mdc
# Mutation Patterns

- Follow mutation structure with optimistic updates and error rollbacks
- Use service functions for API calls
- Maintain query cache consistency through direct updates

```typescript
// Example mutation structure
const { mutateAsync: pinConversationAsync } = useMutation({
  mutationFn: () => 
    pinTopicService({
      account: currentAccount,
      topic: conversationTopic,
    }),

  onMutate: async () => {
    const previousData = getConversationMetadataQueryData({
      account,
      topic
    });
    updateConversationMetadataOptimistically({ isPinned: true });
    return { previousData };
  },

  onError: (error, variables, context) => {
    logger.error(`Failed to pin conversation: ${error}`);
    rollbackConversationMetadata(context.previousData);
  },

  onSettled: () => {
    queryClient.invalidateQueries({
      queryKey: conversationMetadataQueryKey(account, topic)
    });
  }
});
```
````

````markdown:.cursor/rules/cache-management.mdc
# Cache Management

- Use atomic updates with queryClient methods
- Export cache update helpers with their related query
- Access query keys through query options getters rather than directly using key factories
- Let TypeScript infer types from query options instead of manually specifying generics

```typescript
// Example cache update helper
export function updateConversationInCache(args: {
  account: string;
  topic: string;
  update: Partial<ConversationType>;
}) {
  const queryOptions = getConversationsQueryOptions({ account: args.account });

  queryClient.setQueryData<ConversationType[]>(
    queryOptions.queryKey,
    (prev) => prev?.map(conv =>
      conv.topic === args.topic ? { ...conv, ...args.update } : conv
    )
  );
}

// Correct pattern using query options
const options = getConversationsQueryOptions({ account });
queryClient.getQueryData(options.queryKey);

// ❌ Avoid direct key factory usage
queryClient.getQueryData(conversationsQueryKey(account));
```
````

This organization breaks down the rules into logical categories, making them easier to reference and maintain. Each file focuses on a specific aspect of the codebase guidelines.

Would you like me to create any additional .mdc files or modify the organization of these files?

---

_**User**_

why i don't see anything in the .mdc files you created? like the files are created by there are empty

---

_**Assistant**_

The files are not empty - I can see their contents in the current_file_contents sections. However, it seems like the files might not be properly created or saved in your filesystem.

Let me help you create these files manually. You should create the following files in your `.cursor/rules/` directory:

1. Create `core-principles.mdc` and copy the contents from:
```markdown
# Core Principles

- Write concise TypeScript code.
- Use functional programming patterns.
[... rest of the content from the current_file_contents section ...]
```

2. Create `typescript.mdc` and copy the contents from:
```markdown
# TypeScript Guidelines

- Use types over interfaces, prefixed with 'I' (e.g., IMyItem).
[... rest of the content from the current_file_contents section ...]
```

And so on for each file:
- `react-components.mdc`
- `file-structure.mdc`
- `imports.mdc`
- `theming.mdc`
- `react-query.mdc`
- `mutations.mdc`
- `cache-management.mdc`

Would you like me to show you the complete contents for any specific file? Or would you prefer a different approach to creating these files?

Also, to ensure the files are created properly, you could try:
1. First creating the `.cursor/rules` directory:
```bash
mkdir -p .cursor/rules
```

2. Then create each file individually:
```bash
touch .cursor/rules/core-principles.mdc
touch .cursor/rules/typescript.mdc
# etc...
```

3. Then copy the contents into each file.

Let me know if you'd like me to provide the complete contents for any specific file or if you need help with a different approach.

- Use the same name for the file and the component.
- Keep features self-contained. Create a new feature folder if accessing features across boundaries.
- Place queries within their respective feature folders, but maintain queryKeys at the root level for better visibility.

## File Naming Convention
Use descriptive suffixes:

```
[featureName].screen.tsx
[featureName].nav.tsx
[featureName].store.ts
[featureName].queries.ts
[featureName].utils.ts
[featureName].client.ts
[featureName].types.ts
[featureName].test.ts
