In iOS (SF Symbols), there are several shield-related icons you might want to use. Here are the common shield variations we could add to your icon types:

```typescript:design-system/Icon/Icon.types.ts
// ... existing icons ...
  | "pin.slash"
  | "shield"
  | "shield.fill"
  | "shield.slash"
  | "shield.slash.fill"
  | "shield.checkmark"
  | "shield.checkmark.fill";
```

These shield icons are commonly used in iOS and represent:
- `shield`: Outline shield icon
- `shield.fill`: Filled shield icon
- `shield.slash`: Crossed-out shield (outline)
- `shield.slash.fill`: Crossed-out shield (filled)
- `shield.checkmark`: Shield with checkmark (outline)
- `shield.checkmark.fill`: Shield with checkmark (filled)

These are particularly useful for security, protection, or verification-related features in your app. Would you like me to add any of these variations to your `IIconName` type?
