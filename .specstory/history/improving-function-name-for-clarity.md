better function name

I'll help rename the function to be more descriptive. Since the function checks if a conversation is unread by comparing timestamps, we can make it more specific.

```typescript:features/conversation/utils/conversation-is-unread-by-current-account.ts
// ... existing imports ...

export function conversationIsUnreadByTimestamp(args: {
  lastMessageSent: number;
  readUntil: number;
}) {
  // ... rest of the function remains the same ...
}
```

The new name `conversationIsUnreadByTimestamp` better describes:
1. What it's checking (conversation unread status)
2. How it's doing the check (by comparing timestamps)

This follows our style guide by:
- Using descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (is)
- Being specific about the implementation method
- Maintaining the existing function pattern with object params
