make this cleaner. I feel it'S hard to read what is happening. but don't create external stuff, everything needs to be insinde the useMemo.

I'll help clean up the code inside the `conversation-search-results-list.tsx` file to make it more readable. Here's a cleaner version with better organization and comments:

```typescript:features/search/components/conversation-search-results-list.tsx
// ... existing code ...

const items: SearchResultItem[] = [];

// Wait until we finish loading both existing and searched results
if (!existingConversationMembershipSearchResults || !searchConvosUsersData) {
  return items;
}

// If we have selected users, only show profiles
if (selectedSearchUserInboxIds.length > 0) {
  return searchConvosUsersData?.inboxIds.map((inboxId) => ({
    type: "profile" as const,
    inboxId,
  }));
}

const {
  existingDmTopics,
  existingGroupsByMemberNameTopics,
  existingGroupsByGroupNameTopics,
} = existingConversationMembershipSearchResults;

// 1. Add DMs first
items.push(
  ...existingDmTopics
    .map((conversationTopic) => ({
      type: "dm" as const,
      conversationTopic,
    }))
    .slice(0, MAX_INITIAL_RESULTS)
);

// 2. Add groups where member names match the search query
items.push(
  ...existingGroupsByMemberNameTopics
    .map((conversationTopic) => ({
      type: "group" as const,
      conversationTopic,
    }))
    .slice(0, MAX_INITIAL_RESULTS)
);

// 3. Add groups where group names match the search query
// Filter out any groups that were already added due to member name matches
const uniqueGroupNameMatches = existingGroupsByGroupNameTopics.filter(
  (topic) =>
    !existingGroupsByMemberNameTopics.includes(topic) &&
    !existingDmTopics.includes(topic)
);

items.push(
  ...uniqueGroupNameMatches
    .map((conversationTopic) => ({
      type: "group" as const,
      conversationTopic,
    }))
    .slice(0, MAX_INITIAL_RESULTS)
);

// 4. Add user profiles that aren't already in DMs
const profilesNotInDms = searchConvosUsersData?.inboxIds
  .map((inboxId) => ({
    type: "profile" as const,
    inboxId,
  }))
  .filter((item) => {
    // Skip if the profile is already in a DM conversation
    return !existingDmTopics.some((topic) => {
      const members = getGroupMembersQueryData({
        account: getCurrentAccount()!,
        topic,
      });
      const peerInboxId = getDmPeerInboxIdQueryData({
        account: getCurrentAccount()!,
        topic,
        caller: "ConversationSearchResultsList",
      });
      
      return (
        peerInboxId === item.inboxId ||
        members?.ids.some((inboxId) => inboxId === item.inboxId)
      );
    });
  });

items.push(...(profilesNotInDms ?? []));

return items;
```

Key improvements made:

1. Added clear section comments to show the order and purpose of each addition
2. Improved variable naming (e.g., `uniqueGroupNameMatches`, `profilesNotInDms`)
3. Separated the group name filtering logic into a more readable format
4. Added null coalescing for profiles to handle undefined case
5. Maintained all functionality while making the code flow more obvious

The code now clearly shows the four main sections of search results being added in order:
1. Direct Messages
2. Groups (by member name matches)
3. Groups (by group name matches)
4. User profiles (excluding those already in DMs)

Each section is clearly commented and separated, making it easier to understand the search results composition process.
