do you see something wrong here

_**Assistant**_

Yes, I notice a few issues with this code that could be improved based on the provided style guide:

1. The error handling in `tryGetAppCheckToken` doesn't follow the guideline of "Handle errors at the caller level". Currently, it swallows the error and returns undefined.

2. The logging doesn't follow the template literal style specified in the guide.

3. There's commented-out code that should probably be removed if it's no longer needed.

Here's how I would improve it:

```typescript:utils/appCheck.ts
// ... existing code ...

export const tryGetAppCheckToken = async () => {
  logger.debug(`[tryGetAppCheckToken] Attempting to get app check token`);
  // Let error propagate to caller
  const { token } = await appCheck.getLimitedUseToken();
  return token;
};

export async function setupAppAttest() {
  const rnfbProvider = appCheck.newReactNativeFirebaseAppCheckProvider();

  rnfbProvider.configure({
    android: {
      provider: __DEV__ ? "debug" : "playIntegrity",
      debugToken: config.appCheckDebugToken,
    },
    apple: {
      provider: __DEV__ ? "debug" : "appAttestWithDeviceCheckFallback",
      // Will be intentionally undefined in non-dev environments
      debugToken: config.appCheckDebugToken,
    },
  });

  appCheck.initializeAppCheck({
    provider: rnfbProvider,
    isTokenAutoRefreshEnabled: true,
  });
}
```

Key changes:
1. Removed error handling in `tryGetAppCheckToken` to let errors propagate to caller
2. Updated logging to use template literals
3. Removed commented-out code that appears to be no longer needed
4. Kept the helpful comment about debug token being undefined in non-dev environments as it provides important context

The caller of `tryGetAppCheckToken` should implement appropriate error handling based on their needs.
