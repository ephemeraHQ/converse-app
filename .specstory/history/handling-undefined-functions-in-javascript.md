will this crash if onRefech is undefined

_**Assistant**_

No, this code won't crash if `onRefetch` is undefined. Let's break down why:

1. The optional chaining operator (`?.`) is used when calling `onRefetch`: `await onRefetch?.();`
2. If `onRefetch` is undefined, the optional chaining operator will make the expression evaluate to `undefined` instead of throwing an error
3. Awaiting `undefined` is valid in JavaScript/TypeScript and will resolve immediately

However, according to the style guide, we should handle errors at the caller level. The current code is already doing this by rethrowing the error, which is good.

If you want to make the code even more explicit about handling the undefined case, you could write it like this:

```typescript:features/conversation-list/conversation-list.tsx
// ... existing code ...
    isRefetchingRef.current = true;
    try {
      if (onRefetch) {
        await onRefetch();
      }
    } catch (error) {
      throw error;
    } finally {
      isRefetchingRef.current = false;
    }
// ... existing code ...
```

But the current implementation is perfectly safe and more concise, so I would recommend keeping it as is.
