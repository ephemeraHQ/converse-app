## Reviewing ESLint Plugin Rules Usage (11/6/2024, 2:48:24 PM)

ok so basically i have lots of plugins here but their rules aren't used right now right?

Looking at your ESLint config, while you have imported several plugins, you're only using a subset of their available rules. Here's a breakdown:

1. **@typescript-eslint**: You're using 4 rules
   - no-unused-vars
   - no-explicit-any
   - explicit-function-return-type
   - consistent-type-definitions

2. **react**: You're using 2 rules
   - jsx-key
   - jsx-no-bind

3. **import**: You're using 2 rules
   - no-default-export
   - order (but it's turned off)

4. **react-hooks**: You're using 2 rules
   - exhaustive-deps
   - rules-of-hooks

5. **react-native**: You're using 2 rules
   - no-inline-styles
   - no-raw-text

Each of these plugins comes with many more rules that you could enable. For example:
- `@typescript-eslint` has 100+ rules
- `eslint-plugin-react` has 50+ rules
- `eslint-plugin-import` has 30+ rules

If you want to enforce more TypeScript/React best practices, you might want to consider enabling more rules from these plugins. Would you like me to suggest some commonly used rules from any of these plugins?

can i do like ...pluginReact.rules to have all of them?

Yes, you can use the `recommended` configs from plugins! Here's how to modify your config to include all recommended rules from each plugin:

```javascript:eslint.config.mjs
// ... imports stay the same ...

export default [
  {
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    // ... other config stays the same ...
    rules: {
      // Extend recommended configs
      ...pluginTypescript.configs['recommended'].rules,
      ...pluginReact.configs['recommended'].rules,
      ...pluginImport.configs['recommended'].rules,
      ...pluginReactHooks.configs['recommended'].rules,
      ...pluginReactNative.configs['all'].rules,

      // Your overrides stay after the spreads to take precedence
      "import/no-default-export": "warn",
      "import/order": "off",
      // ... rest of your custom rules ...
    },
    // ... rest of config stays the same ...
  },
  // ... second config object stays the same ...
];
```

This will include all recommended rules from each plugin. Note that:
1. Some plugins use `recommended` while others might use `all` for their preset configurations
2. You can still override specific rules after spreading the recommended configs
3. Your custom rules should come after the spreads to ensure they take precedence

You might want to test this change carefully as it will enable many new rules at once, which could result in a lot of new lint errors in your codebase.
