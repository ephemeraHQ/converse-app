I'll help improve the animated text carousel logic. The current implementation has a potential issue with the wrap-around animation and could be made clearer. Here's how we can fix it:

```typescript:components/animated-text-carousel.tsx
// ... existing code ...

      interval = setInterval(() => {
        const currentIndex = indexRef.current;
        const newIndex = (currentIndex + 1) % texts.length;
        indexRef.current = newIndex;

        // When transitioning from last to first item, animate through an intermediate value
        // to create a smooth fade transition
        if (newIndex === 0) {
          // First animate to an intermediate value (texts.length + 0.5)
          indexAV.value = withTiming(
            texts.length + 0.5,
            { duration: msDelayBetweenTextChange / 2 },
            (finished) => {
              if (finished) {
                // Then instantly jump to 0 and animate to 1
                indexAV.value = 0;
                indexAV.value = withTiming(1, {
                  duration: msDelayBetweenTextChange / 2,
                });
              }
            }
          );
        } else {
          // Normal case: animate to the next index + 1 for the fade effect
          indexAV.value = withTiming(newIndex + 1, {
            duration: msDelayBetweenTextChange,
          });
        }
      }, msDelayBetweenTextChange);

// ... existing code ...
```

The changes made:

1. Simplified the wrap-around condition to just check `newIndex === 0`
2. Added a `finished` check in the callback to ensure the first animation completed
3. Made the animation sequence clearer with better comments
4. Fixed the animation values to be more consistent (using 0 to 1 transition for the first item)

This should create a smoother transition when wrapping from the last item back to the first item in the carousel, while maintaining the fade effect throughout all transitions.
