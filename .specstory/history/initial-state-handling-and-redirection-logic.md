## Initial State Handling and Redirection Logic (10/2/2024, 10:28:17 AM)

_**User**_

the problem I thnk i have, is let's say the user signs out , isSignedIn will change to false, so the useEffect will retrigger. It won't do anything but if the user signed in again, it will retrigger it again and push the user to the url when they first opened the app with. But maybe after we pushed the user we need to clear it or something? I dont know

_**Assistant**_

You're right to be concerned about this behavior. The current implementation could indeed lead to unexpected redirections when a user signs out and then signs back in. Let's modify the code to address this issue. We'll introduce a state to track whether we've already handled the initial redirection and clear the URL after it's been processed.

Here's how we can update the `InitialStateHandler` component:

```typescript:components/StateHandlers/InitialStateHandler.tsx
export default function InitialStateHandler() {
  const colorScheme = useColorScheme();
  const url = Linking.useURL();
  const isSignedIn = !!useCurrentAccount();
  const [hasHandledInitialRedirection, setHasHandledInitialRedirection] = useState(false);

  const {
    setSplashScreenHidden,
    hydrationDone,
    navigationReady,
    splashScreenHidden,
    setInitialURL,
  } = useAppStore(
    useSelect([
      "setSplashScreenHidden",
      "hydrationDone",
      "navigationReady",
      "splashScreenHidden",
      "setInitialURL",
    ])
  );

  // ... existing useEffect for setAndroidColors ...

  // ... existing useEffect for splash screen ...

  /**
   * Redirection
   */
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!hydrationDone || !splashScreenHidden || !navigationReady || !isSignedIn || hasHandledInitialRedirection) {
      return;
    }

    async function handleRedirection() {
      try {
        if (topicToNavigateTo) {
          await navigateToTopicWithRetry();
        } else if (url) {
          const schemedURL = getSchemedURLFromUniversalURL(url);
          if (schemedURL && !isDevelopmentClientURL(schemedURL)) {
            logger.debug("Opening URL:", schemedURL);
            await Linking.openURL(schemedURL);
          }
        }
        setHasHandledInitialRedirection(true);
        setInitialURL(null); // Clear the initial URL after handling
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Failed to handle redirection:", error);
        sentryTrackError(error);
      }
    }

    handleRedirection();
  }, [hydrationDone, url, splashScreenHidden, navigationReady, isSignedIn, hasHandledInitialRedirection, setInitialURL]);

  return null;
}
```

Here's what we've changed:

1. We've introduced a new state variable `hasHandledInitialRedirection` using the `useState` hook. This will help us track whether we've already handled the initial redirection.

2. We've simplified the conditions in the `useEffect` dependency array and moved them to the top of the effect function for clarity.

3. We've added `setInitialURL` to the list of selected store values. This assumes you have a method in your app store to set the initial URL to null after it's been handled.

4. After handling the redirection, we set `hasHandledInitialRedirection` to `true` and clear the initial URL by calling `setInitialURL(null)`.

5. We've added `hasHandledInitialRedirection` and `setInitialURL` to the dependency array of the `useEffect`.

These changes ensure that:

- The redirection logic only runs once when all conditions are met.
- After the initial redirection is handled, it won't run again even if the user signs out and signs back in.
- The initial URL is cleared after it's been processed, preventing any accidental redirections in the future.

You'll need to add the `setInitialURL` method to your app store if it doesn't already exist. This method should update the store to clear the initial URL after it's been handled.

This approach should solve the problem of unexpected redirections when users sign out and sign back in, while still allowing for proper initial URL handling when the app is first opened.
