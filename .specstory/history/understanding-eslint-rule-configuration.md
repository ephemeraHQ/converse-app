## Understanding ESLint Rule Configuration (11/6/2024, 11:14:19 AM)

what does "'no-unused-styles': 0," putting 0 is off right?

_**Assistant**_

Yes, that's correct! In ESLint configuration, there are typically 3 levels for rules:

- `0` or `"off"` - Rule is completely disabled
- `1` or `"warn"` - Rule will give warnings but won't fail
- `2` or `"error"` - Rule will give errors and fail the linting

So `"no-unused-styles": 0` is equivalent to `"no-unused-styles": "off"`. Both will disable the rule completely.

If you want to add this rule to your ESLint config, here's how you would add it:

```json:.eslintrc.json
{
  // ... existing code ...
  "rules": {
    // ... other rules ...
    "react-native/no-unused-styles": "off",  // or 0 if you prefer
    // ... other rules ...
  }
}
```

I recommend using the string values (`"off"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`) over numbers as they're more readable and self-documenting.
