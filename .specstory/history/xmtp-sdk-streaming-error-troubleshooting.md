## XMTP SDK Streaming Error Troubleshooting (1/28/2025, 3:57:36 PM)

_**User**_

ii tested it with the throw test but i got this error shown " ERROR : [XMTP SDK] Failed to stream messages " the "test" error wasn't there?

Ah, I see the issue. The error message you're seeing is because the `XMTPError` is wrapping the original error. Let's modify the error handling to preserve and log the original error message while still throwing the wrapped error. Here's how we can fix it:

```typescript:utils/xmtpRN/xmtp-messages/xmtp-messages-stream.ts
// ... existing code ...
  try {
    throw new Error("test");
    await client.conversations.streamAllMessages(async (message) => {
      // ... existing code ...
    });
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error(
      `[XMTP - streamAllMessages] Original error: ${
        error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error)
      }`
    );
    throw new XMTPError("Failed to stream messages", error);
  }
// ... existing code ...
```

This change will:
1. Log the original error message before throwing the wrapped error
2. Handle cases where `error` might not be an Error instance using a ternary operator
3. Still throw the wrapped `XMTPError` for consistent error handling

Now when you test it, you should see both:
- The original "test" error message in the logs
- The wrapped "Failed to stream messages" error

You can remove the `throw new Error("test");` line after testing.

no i want to use only the XMTPError check @error.ts

Ah, I see! Looking at the `XMTPError` class in `error.ts`, it already handles the cause internally. The error message is automatically prefixed with "[XMTP SDK]" and includes the original error as the cause. No need for additional logging since the error structure is already well-defined.

Let's keep it simple:

```typescript:utils/xmtpRN/xmtp-messages/xmtp-messages-stream.ts
// ... existing code ...
  try {
    throw new Error("test");
    await client.conversations.streamAllMessages(async (message) => {
      // ... existing code ...
    });
  } catch (error) {
    throw new XMTPError("Failed to stream messages", error);
  }
// ... existing code ...
```

When you throw `new Error("test")`, the `XMTPError` will wrap it as:
- Message: "[XMTP SDK] Failed to stream messages"
- Cause: Error("test")

This follows our error handling pattern and preserves the original error as the cause. You can remove the `throw new Error("test");` line after testing.

but thtis is what i have!! But then in my terminal i can't see the "tesT"

Ah, I understand now! The issue is that we need to see the actual error message in the logs. Let's use the logger to show both the wrapped error and its cause before throwing:

```typescript:utils/xmtpRN/xmtp-messages/xmtp-messages-stream.ts
// ... existing code ...
  try {
    throw new Error("test");
    await client.conversations.streamAllMessages(async (message) => {
      // ... existing code ...
    });
  } catch (error) {
    const xmtpError = new XMTPError("Failed to stream messages", error);
    logger.error(
      `[XMTP - streamAllMessages] Error: ${xmtpError.message}, Cause: ${xmtpError.cause}`
    );
    throw xmtpError;
  }
// ... existing code ...
```

Now you should see both:
1. The wrapped error message "[XMTP SDK] Failed to stream messages"
2. The original "test" error as the cause in your terminal logs

This maintains our error handling pattern while making the error details visible in the logs for debugging.

NOOOO I JSUT WANT TO USE XMTP ERROR DONT ADD LOGGER

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for the confusion! You're absolutely right - let's keep it simple and just use the `XMTPError` as it is, exactly as you have it now:

```typescript:utils/xmtpRN/xmtp-messages/xmtp-messages-stream.ts
  try {
    throw new Error("test");
    await client.conversations.streamAllMessages(async (message) => {
      // ... existing code ...
    });
  } catch (error) {
    throw new XMTPError("Failed to stream messages", error);
  }
```

If you're not seeing the "test" error message in your terminal, the issue might be with how errors are being logged at a higher level in your application, not with this code. This code is correctly wrapping and passing along the original error as the `cause`.

_**User**_

but why if i do logger.error(error); i don't see the "cause" that is added in @error.ts ???

_**Assistant**_



Ah, now I understand your question! The issue is that when you pass an error directly to `logger.error()`, it doesn't automatically log the error's `cause` property. The `cause` property is part of the error object, but most logging functions don't automatically traverse and display it.

To see both the error and its cause, you need to explicitly log both. Here's how you could modify the `captureError` function to show both:

```typescript:utils/capture-error.ts
export function captureError(
  error: unknown,
  options?: {
    message?: string;
    caller?: string;
  }
) {
  const { message, caller } = options || {};
  const prefix = caller ? `[${caller}]` : message ? `${message}:` : "";

  if (error instanceof Error && error.cause) {
    if (prefix) {
      logger.error(`${prefix} ${error.message}`, `Caused by:`, error.cause);
    } else {
      logger.error(error.message, `Caused by:`, error.cause);
    }
  } else {
    if (prefix) {
      logger.error(prefix, error);
    } else {
      logger.error(error);
    }
  }
}
```

This modification will:
1. Check if the error is an Error instance and has a cause
2. If it does, log both the error message and its cause
3. If it doesn't, fall back to the original logging behavior

Now when you use `captureError` with an `XMTPError`, you should see both the wrapped error message and the original "test" error that caused it.
