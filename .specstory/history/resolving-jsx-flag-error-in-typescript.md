## Resolving JSX Flag Error in TypeScript (11/7/2024, 7:29:20 AM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Cannot use JSX unless the '--jsx' flag is provided.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

This error occurs because TypeScript needs to know how to handle JSX syntax. You have two options to fix this:

1. Add JSX configuration to your `tsconfig.json`:

```typescript:tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "jsx": "react-native",
    // ... other options
  }
}
```

2. Or rename the file extension from `.tsx` to `.jsx` if you're not using TypeScript features in this file.

Given that you're using TypeScript throughout the project, I recommend the first option - adding the JSX configuration to your tsconfig.json file.
