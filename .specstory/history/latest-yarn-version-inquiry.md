_**Assistant**_

Yarn 4.6.0 is not the latest version. The current latest stable version of Yarn is 4.1.1 (as of March 2024). 

Interestingly, `yarn@4.6.0` appears to be an incorrect or non-existent version number, as Yarn 4.6.0 has not been released. The Yarn version numbering goes:

- Yarn 1.x (Classic)
- Yarn 2.x (Berry)
- Yarn 3.x (Berry)
- Yarn 4.x (Berry) - Current major version

I would recommend updating the `packageManager` field to use the latest stable version:

```json:package.json
  "packageManager": "yarn@4.1.1",
```

This version was released in February 2024 and includes various improvements and bug fixes. You can view the official releases on GitHub: https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/releases
