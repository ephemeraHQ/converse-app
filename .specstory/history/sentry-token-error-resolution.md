This error occurs because there's an issue with the Sentry authentication token format in your GitHub workflow. The error suggests that the token contains spaces or is not being properly parsed. Let's fix this in the deploy-preview.yml file.

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
// ... existing code ...
        env:
          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
// ... existing code ...
```

Here's what we changed and why:

1. Instead of using the `eas env:get` command which might introduce formatting issues, we should use GitHub secrets directly.
2. The `${{ secrets.SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN }}` syntax is the proper way to access GitHub secrets in workflows.

To make this work:

1. Make sure you have added your Sentry auth token as a GitHub secret named `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Add a new repository secret named `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
   - Paste your Sentry auth token (without any spaces or quotes)

This should resolve the "Invalid token header" error you're seeing. The token should be a clean string without any spaces or special characters.

NO i want from eas env:get

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I understand now. The issue is with how the command output is being processed. Let's fix the command to properly handle the token:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
// ... existing code ...
        env:
          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: $(eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview --json | jq -r '.value')
// ... existing code ...
```

The changes:
1. Added `--json` flag to get clean JSON output from EAS
2. Used `jq -r '.value'` to extract just the value field from the JSON output
3. The `-r` flag in jq ensures we get a raw string without quotes

This should properly parse the Sentry token from EAS environment variables without any spaces or formatting issues. The `jq` command will cleanly extract just the token value from the JSON response.

Make sure `jq` is available in your GitHub Actions environment (it should be by default in Ubuntu runners).

---

_**User**_

there is no --json option availabe

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah, you're right - my apologies. Let's try a different approach using string manipulation to clean the output:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
// ... existing code ...
        env:
          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: $(eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview | tr -d ' ' | cut -d'=' -f2)
// ... existing code ...
```

The changes:
1. Added `tr -d ' '` to remove any spaces from the output
2. Kept the `cut -d'=' -f2` to get the value after the equals sign
3. Removed the non-existent `--json` option

This should properly clean the token output from EAS and remove any problematic spaces. The `tr` command removes all spaces, and `cut` extracts just the token value after the equals sign.

_**User**_

still same error. can i run this command local on my Mac? and simulate what it would do on the same machine? I think we're using unbutu machine for git action

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you can simulate this command locally! To simulate the Ubuntu environment from GitHub Actions, you can use Docker. Here's how:

1. First, run an Ubuntu container interactively:
```bash
docker run -it --rm ubuntu:latest bash
```

2. Inside the container, you'll need to:
   - Install curl (for EAS CLI installation)
   - Install Node.js
   - Install EAS CLI

Here's the commands to run inside the container:
```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
npm install -g eas-cli
```

3. Then you can test the exact command:
```bash
eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview | tr -d ' ' | cut -d'=' -f2
```

Note: You'll need to login to your Expo account first using:
```bash
eas login
```

This will help you debug exactly what the command outputs in the same environment as your GitHub Action. You can then inspect the output character by character to see if there are any hidden characters or formatting issues causing the Sentry validation to fail.

Would you like to try this approach to debug the issue?

_**User**_

how can i go insinde the container

---

_**Assistant**_



Once you run the `docker run` command, you'll automatically be inside the container. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. First, run this command in your terminal:
```bash
docker run -it --rm ubuntu:latest bash
```

You'll see the prompt change to something like:
```
root@<container-id>:/#
```

This means you're now inside the container! You can then run all the setup commands I mentioned:

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y curl
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_18.x | bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
npm install -g eas-cli
eas login
```

To exit the container at any time, just type:
```bash
exit
```

The `--rm` flag in our docker command means the container will be automatically removed when you exit it.

Would you like to try this? I can help guide you through any step.

_**User**_

ok doens't work... can i do something else? Like run the git action locally or something else?

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes! You can use `act` to run GitHub Actions locally. This is a great tool for testing GitHub Actions workflows on your machine. Here's how:

1. First, install `act` using Homebrew:
```bash
brew install act
```

2. From your project root directory, run the specific job that's failing:
```bash
act -j deploy-preview
```

Or if you want to see more details about what's happening:
```bash
act -j deploy-preview --verbose
```

You might need to create a `.secrets` file in your project root with any required secrets, or you can pass them directly:
```bash
act -j deploy-preview --secret EXPO_TOKEN=your_expo_token
```

This will run your GitHub Action workflow locally and you can see exactly what's happening with the Sentry token command.

Would you like to try this approach? I can help you set it up and debug the output.

_**User**_

but if i run deploy-preview it might wont have any changes. but can i simulate some typescript changes for example so it can run the eas update

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes! You can simulate changes to trigger the EAS update. Here's how:

1. First, make a small change to any TypeScript file, for example add a comment or change a console.log. This ensures there's a change to deploy.

2. Then, you can run just the specific step that's failing instead of the whole workflow. With `act`, you can use the `-s` flag to start from a specific step:

```bash
act -j deploy-preview -s "Deploy to Expo"
```

Or if you want to test just the command itself without running the whole action, you can try this directly in your terminal:

```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=$(eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview | tr -d ' ' | cut -d'=' -f2)
echo $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
```

This will show you exactly what value is being set for the token. If you see any extra characters or formatting issues, we can adjust the command accordingly.

Would you like to try either of these approaches? I can help you debug whichever method you prefer.

ok doing "export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=$(eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview | tr -d ' ' | cut -d'=' -f2)
echo $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN" WORKS!!! but why do i still get the error:

⬆️ Uploading dist/_expo/static/js/android/index-f068222f231a8bd5e3a17e528730dbad.hbc bundle and sourcemap...

Let's debug this further. Since we know the token extraction works locally but fails in the GitHub Action, let's try to:

1. Add debug logging to see what's happening
2. Ensure the token is properly set in the environment

Update the workflow file:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
// ... existing code ...
        env:
          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: $(eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview | tr -d ' ' | cut -d'=' -f2)
          SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL: debug
        run: |
          # Debug: Print token length and first/last few characters (safely)
          token_length=${#SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN}
          echo "Token length: $token_length"
          echo "Token starts with: ${SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN:0:4}..."
          echo "Token ends with: ...${SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: -4}"
          
          # Continue with your existing commands
          eas update --auto
// ... existing code ...
```

This will:
1. Enable Sentry debug logging
2. Print the token length and partial token (safely, without exposing the full token)
3. Help us see if the token is being set correctly in the GitHub Action environment

The error suggests the token has spaces, but our local test shows it doesn't. This debug output will help us see if something is different in the GitHub Action environment or if the token is being modified somewhere in the process.

Would you like to try this and share the debug output (it's safe as it only shows length and partial token)?

_**User**_

feel free to print the token i don't care 

---

_**Assistant**_



Alright, let's print the full token to see exactly what's happening:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
// ... existing code ...
        env:
          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: $(eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview | tr -d ' ' | cut -d'=' -f2)
          SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL: debug
        run: |
          # Debug: Print full token and its length
          echo "Full token: $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN"
          echo "Token length: ${#SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN}"
          
          # Print the exact command output before processing
          echo "Raw EAS output:"
          eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview
          
          # Continue with your existing commands
          eas update --auto
// ... existing code ...
```

This will show us:
1. The full token that's being set
2. The raw output from EAS before processing
3. The token length

This should help us identify if there are any hidden characters, line breaks, or other issues that might be causing the "Invalid token header" error.

_**User**_

the command i need to run is "npx sentry-expo-upload-sourcemaps dist" btw

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah, that's important context! Let's modify the workflow to run the correct command and see what's happening:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
// ... existing code ...
        env:
          SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN: $(eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview | tr -d ' ' | cut -d'=' -f2)
          SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL: debug
        run: |
          # Debug: Print full token and its length
          echo "Full token: $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN"
          echo "Token length: ${#SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN}"
          
          # Print the exact command output before processing
          echo "Raw EAS output:"
          eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview
          
          # Run the actual Sentry command
          npx sentry-expo-upload-sourcemaps dist
// ... existing code ...
```

Now we're running the correct command for source map upload. This should help us see if there's any specific issue with how sentry-expo is handling the token. The debug output will show us exactly what token value is being passed to the command.

Also, just to verify - are you sure the token in EAS is a valid Sentry auth token? It should start with something like "sntrys_" for newer tokens or be a hex string for older tokens.

_**User**_

Full token: $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN is printing "$(eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview | tr -d ' ' | cut -d'=' -f2)" WTF?

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah! I see the issue now. In GitHub Actions, we need to use a different syntax for command substitution. Let's fix that:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
// ... existing code ...
        run: |
          # First set the token
          export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=$(eas env:get --variable-name=SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN --variable-environment=preview | tr -d ' ' | cut -d'=' -f2)
          
          # Debug: Print full token and its length
          echo "Full token: $SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN"
          echo "Token length: ${#SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN}"
          
          # Run the actual Sentry command
          npx sentry-expo-upload-sourcemaps dist
        env:
          SENTRY_LOG_LEVEL: debug
// ... existing code ...
```

The key changes:
1. Removed the command substitution from the `env:` section
2. Added the token export directly in the `run:` section
3. The command will now execute and set the environment variable properly

The issue was that GitHub Actions wasn't evaluating the command in the `env:` section - it was treating it as a literal string. By moving it to the `run:` section, the command will be properly executed.

---

_**User**_

it means that SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN will be in env varaible?

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes, exactly! When you use `export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN=...` in the `run:` section, it sets SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN as an environment variable that will be available to all subsequent commands in that same `run:` block.

So the sequence will be:
1. The `export` command runs and sets SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN with the value from EAS
2. Then `echo` can access it using `$SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`
3. Finally, when `npx sentry-expo-upload-sourcemaps` runs, it will be able to access this environment variable

This is different from the `env:` section in the YAML which sets environment variables before the `run:` block starts. By moving it inside the `run:` block, we ensure the command is actually executed and the environment variable is set with the proper value from EAS.

Would you like me to add any additional debug steps to verify the environment variable is set correctly?
