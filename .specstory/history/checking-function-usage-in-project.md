## Checking Function Usage in Project (1/28/2025, 10:11:12 AM)

_**User**_

can you checkj if this function is used in any place in our project?

---

_**Assistant**_

I can't directly check if this function is used in your project since I don't have access to your entire codebase. However, I can suggest a few ways you can check this yourself:

1. If you're using VSCode, you can:
   - Right-click on the `isPrivyAccount` function
   - Select "Find All References" (or press Shift + F12)
   - This will show all places where this function is used

2. Using the command line:
   ```bash
   grep -r "isPrivyAccount" ./
   ```
   This will search recursively through your project directory for any occurrences of "isPrivyAccount"

3. If you're using TypeScript/JavaScript, you can temporarily comment out or rename the function. The TypeScript compiler will then show errors anywhere the function is being used.

Looking at the code you provided, I notice that there are other Privy-related functions like `useLoggedWithPrivy` and `useHasOnePrivyAccount`, but `isPrivyAccount` seems to be a standalone utility function. If it's not being used, you might want to consider removing it to keep your codebase clean.

do you have anything i can you to clean up a file with all the stuff that aren't used anything in my project?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes! Here are several tools and approaches you can use to clean up unused code in your project:

1. **ESLint with `no-unused-vars` rule**
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "no-unused-vars": "error",
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": "error"
  }
}
```

2. **TypeScript Compiler Options** - Add these to your `tsconfig.json`:
```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true
  }
}
```

3. **VS Code Extension: Coverage Gutters** - Shows code coverage including unused code

4. **ts-prune** - A utility specifically for finding unused exports in TypeScript projects:
```bash
# Install
npm install -g ts-prune

# Run
ts-prune

# Or for a specific path
ts-prune ./src
```

5. **depcheck** - Checks for unused dependencies in your project:
```bash
# Install
npm install -g depcheck

# Run
depcheck
```

6. **webpack-bundle-analyzer** - Shows you what's actually being bundled:
```bash
npm install -D webpack-bundle-analyzer
```

For your specific case with TypeScript exports, I'd recommend starting with `ts-prune` as it's specifically designed for finding unused exports in TypeScript projects. It will show you a list of exported functions, types, and variables that aren't being imported anywhere in your project.

Example output from ts-prune:
```bash
/path/to/file.ts:10:0 - isPrivyAccount
/path/to/file.ts:15:0 - unused_function
```

Would you like me to explain how to set up any of these tools in more detail?

how can i use ts-prune on a single path and delete all the stuff that isn't used?

Here's a step-by-step guide to use ts-prune on a single path and clean up unused exports:

1. **Install ts-prune** (if you haven't already):
```bash
npm install -g ts-prune
```

2. **Run ts-prune on a specific path**:
```bash
ts-prune ./features/notifications
```

3. **To automatically remove unused exports**, you can pipe the output to a script. Here's a solution using Node.js. Create a file called `remove-unused.js`:

```javascript:remove-unused.js
const fs = require('fs');
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

// Run ts-prune and capture output
const path = process.argv[2];
if (!path) {
  console.error('Please provide a path');
  process.exit(1);
}

try {
  const output = execSync(`ts-prune ${path}`).toString();
  
  // Parse ts-prune output
  const unusedExports = output.split('\n')
    .filter(line => line.trim())
    .map(line => {
      const [filePath, position] = line.split(':');
      const exportName = line.split(' - ')[1];
      return { filePath, position, exportName };
    });

  // Process each file
  unusedExports.forEach(({ filePath, exportName }) => {
    if (!exportName) return;
    
    const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    const lines = content.split('\n');
    
    // Remove export declaration
    const newContent = lines
      .filter(line => !line.includes(`export const ${exportName}`))
      .filter(line => !line.includes(`export function ${exportName}`))
      .filter(line => !line.includes(`export type ${exportName}`))
      .join('\n');
    
    fs.writeFileSync(filePath, newContent);
    console.log(`Removed unused export: ${exportName} from ${filePath}`);
  });

} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error.message);
}
```

4. **Run the script**:
```bash
node remove-unused.js ./features/notifications
```

⚠️ **Important Safety Tips**:

1. **ALWAYS commit your changes** before running any automatic code removal tool
2. **Review the ts-prune output first** before running the removal script:
```bash
ts-prune ./features/notifications
```
3. **Consider running in dry-run mode first** by adding a `--dry-run` flag to see what would be removed

Here's a safer version of the script that does a dry run first:

```javascript:remove-unused.js
const fs = require('fs');
const { execSync } = require('child_process');

const path = process.argv[2];
const isDryRun = process.argv.includes('--dry-run');

if (!path) {
  console.error('Please provide a path');
  process.exit(1);
}

try {
  const output = execSync(`ts-prune ${path}`).toString();
  
  const unusedExports = output.split('\n')
    .filter(line => line.trim())
    .map(line => {
      const [filePath, position] = line.split(':');
      const exportName = line.split(' - ')[1];
      return { filePath, position, exportName };
    });

  if (isDryRun) {
    console.log('DRY RUN - The following exports would be removed:');
    unusedExports.forEach(({ filePath, exportName }) => {
      console.log(`${exportName} from ${filePath}`);
    });
    process.exit(0);
  }

  unusedExports.forEach(({ filePath, exportName }) => {
    if (!exportName) return;
    
    const content = fs.readFileSync(filePath, 'utf8');
    const lines = content.split('\n');
    
    const newContent = lines
      .filter(line => !line.includes(`export const ${exportName}`))
      .filter(line => !line.includes(`export function ${exportName}`))
      .filter(line => !line.includes(`export type ${exportName}`))
      .join('\n');
    
    fs.writeFileSync(filePath, newContent);
    console.log(`Removed unused export: ${exportName} from ${filePath}`);
  });

} catch (error) {
  console.error('Error:', error.message);
}
```

Usage:
```bash
# First do a dry run
node remove-unused.js ./features/notifications --dry-run

# If the output looks good, run it for real
node remove-unused.js ./features/notifications
```

This approach is safer because:
1. It shows you what would be removed before actually removing anything
2. It keeps a record of what was removed
3. You can easily revert changes if needed since you committed first

Remember that static analysis tools like ts-prune might have false positives, especially with dynamic imports or complex patterns. Always review the changes before committing them.
