## Naming the Git Workflow Action (2/4/2025, 9:06:36 AM)

_**User**_

I'm debatting if the action should be called "Deploy to production" or "Merge Main to PRoduction" .

_**Assistant**_

Both names could work, but I would recommend keeping it as "Merge Main to Production" since it more accurately describes what the action is actually doing - it's performing a git merge from main to production. This is more precise and helps other developers understand exactly what the workflow does.

If this workflow was doing more deployment-related tasks (like building, deploying to servers, running migrations, etc.), then "Deploy to Production" would be more appropriate. But since it's purely doing a git merge operation, the current name is more accurate.

If you want to update it, here's how the change would look:

```yaml:.github/workflows/merge-main-to-production.yml
name: Merge Main to Production
// ... existing code ...
```

I recommend keeping the current name as is since it:
1. Accurately describes the technical operation being performed
2. Makes it clear this is a git operation rather than a full deployment
3. Helps set correct expectations about what the workflow does
