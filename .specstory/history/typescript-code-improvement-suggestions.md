Based on the code style guide and the current file, here are a few suggestions to improve the code:

```typescript:app.config.ts
// ... existing code ...

// Use type instead of any for env
const env = process.env as Record<string, string | undefined>;
const isDev = env.EXPO_ENV === "dev";

warnOnce(
  isDev && !env.EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_API_URI,
  "\n\nðŸš§ Running the app without EXPO_PUBLIC_DEV_API_URI setup\n\n"
);

// ... existing code ...
```

Key changes:
1. Replaced `any` type with more specific `Record<string, string | undefined>` for better type safety
2. Updated the env usage to use the new type
3. Simplified the env check by removing redundant cast

The rest of the file follows the style guide well with:
- Clear variable names
- Logical organization
- Proper TypeScript usage
- Good separation of concerns
- Clear environment-based configuration

Would you like me to suggest any other improvements?
