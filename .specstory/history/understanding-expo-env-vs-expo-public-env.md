## Understanding EXPO_ENV vs EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV (1/27/2025, 7:35:43 PM)

why would i use EXPO_ENV instead of EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV ??? using the public one i don't have to pass to "extra" right?

Actually, there's an important distinction between `EXPO_ENV` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV`:

1. `EXPO_ENV` is available only at build time (when generating the app config and during the build process)
2. `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV` is available at both build time AND runtime in your app's code

In this specific case, using `EXPO_ENV` is the correct choice because:

1. The app.config.ts file is only executed during build time to generate the app configuration
2. These environment-specific settings (like bundle IDs, package names, etc.) should be determined at build time and shouldn't change during runtime
3. You generally don't want to expose build configuration details to the runtime environment for security reasons

If you need to access the environment in your actual app code during runtime, you would still want to pass it through `extra` as you're doing now:

```typescript:app.config.ts
// ... existing code ...
  extra: {
    expoEnv, // This makes it available at runtime via Constants.expoConfig.extra.expoEnv
    eas: {
      projectId: "49a65fae-3895-4487-8e8a-5bd8bee3a401",
    },
  },
// ... existing code ...
```

Then in your app code, you can access it via:
```typescript
import Constants from 'expo-constants';

const env = Constants.expoConfig.extra.expoEnv;
```

Using `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV` would be more appropriate for runtime configuration values that you need to access directly in your app code, like API endpoints or feature flags.

but in my app i use the env here like "const env = Constants.expoConfig.extra.expoEnv;" so why would i pass to extra and not via EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV?

You make a good point! If you're only using the environment value at runtime in your app code, then using `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV` would be simpler and more direct. Here's how we could modify the config:

```typescript:app.config.ts
// ... existing code ...

export default (): ExpoConfig => {
  const expoEnv = (process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV || "development") as Environment;
  const config = settings[expoEnv];

  return {
    // ... existing code ...
    extra: {
      // Remove expoEnv from here since we'll access it directly
      eas: {
        projectId: "49a65fae-3895-4487-8e8a-5bd8bee3a401",
      },
    },
    // ... existing code ...
  };
};
```

Then in your app code, you could access it directly:
```typescript
const env = process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV as Environment;
```

The main advantages of this approach are:
1. More direct access to the environment variable
2. Less configuration boilerplate (no need to pass through `extra`)
3. TypeScript can better infer the types since it's coming directly from process.env

The only reason you might want to keep it in `extra` is if you need to transform the value during build time or if you need to ensure the value is "locked in" at build time. But if you're just using it as-is, using `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENV` directly is a cleaner approach.
