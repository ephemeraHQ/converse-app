## Error Handling and Logging Practices (1/15/2025, 3:46:17 PM)

just to be sure when we have an error yes we're logging stufg and etc but we still throw the error again at the end right?

Yes, that's correct! Looking at the error interceptor code, after logging the error details, it ultimately returns `Promise.reject(error)` in all error cases:

1. For 401 errors where token refresh fails:
```typescript:utils/api.ts
} catch (refreshError) {
  // Token rotation failed - this is a legitimate authentication failure
  return Promise.reject(refreshError);
}
```

2. For all other error scenarios, at the end of the interceptor:
```typescript:utils/api.ts
return Promise.reject(error);
```

This means that while we log the error details for debugging purposes, we're still properly propagating the error back to the caller, allowing them to handle it appropriately. This follows the principle from your style guide of "Handle errors at the caller level" while still maintaining useful logging for debugging purposes.
