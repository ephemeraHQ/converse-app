can we make cleaner

_**Assistant**_

I'll help make this code cleaner following the style guide. Here's the improved version with better handling of the haptic feedback:

```typescript:features/conversation/conversation-message/conversation-message-repliable.tsx
const HAPTIC_THRESHOLD = 1;

const triggeredHapticAV = useSharedValue(false);

useAnimatedReaction(
  () => progressAV.value,
  (progress) => {
    if (progress > HAPTIC_THRESHOLD && !triggeredHapticAV.value) {
      Haptics.softImpactAsyncAnimated();
      triggeredHapticAV.value = true;
    } else if (progress <= HAPTIC_THRESHOLD) {
      triggeredHapticAV.value = false;
    }
  }
);
```

Key improvements made:
1. Removed the unnecessary tuple array creation and destructuring
2. Simplified the dependency tracking to just `progressAV.value`
3. Added a named constant for the threshold value
4. Made the code more readable with clearer variable naming (`progress` instead of `value`)

The functionality remains the same but the code is now more maintainable and follows cleaner patterns.

no i mean the way I'm using "triggeredHapticAV" . was curious if i could remove it and make the thing less code but not sure

_**Assistant**_

Ah, I see! Yes, we can simplify this by using the progress value itself to determine if we've triggered the haptic feedback. Here's the cleaner version:

```typescript:features/conversation/conversation-message/conversation-message-repliable.tsx
useAnimatedReaction(
  () => progressAV.value,
  (progress, previousProgress) => {
    if (progress > 1 && previousProgress <= 1) {
      Haptics.softImpactAsyncAnimated();
    }
  }
);
```

This is much cleaner because:
1. Removed the need for an additional shared value (`triggeredHapticAV`)
2. Uses `useAnimatedReaction`'s second parameter which gives us access to the previous value
3. Only triggers haptic feedback when we cross the threshold from below to above

The haptic feedback will now trigger exactly the same way, but with less code and state management.
