This issue typically occurs because the cache isn't being properly saved or found between workflow runs. Let's modify the node setup step to fix this issue. The main changes needed are to add a cache-dependency-path and ensure proper permissions.

Here's how to fix it:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
// ... existing code ...
      - name: Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: .nvmrc
          cache: "yarn"
          cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock
        env:
          SKIP_YARN_COREPACK_CHECK: "1"
// ... existing code ...
```

The changes:
1. Added `cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock` to explicitly tell the action where to find the dependency file for caching
2. Make sure your repository has a `yarn.lock` file committed

If you're still seeing cache misses after this change, it could be because:
1. The workflow is running with different node versions
2. The `yarn.lock` file is changing between runs
3. The cache is being invalidated due to changes in dependencies

You can also add cache debugging by modifying the step to:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
      - name: Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: .nvmrc
          cache: "yarn"
          cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock
        env:
          SKIP_YARN_COREPACK_CHECK: "1"
          ACTIONS_STEP_DEBUG: true
```

This will give you more verbose output about the cache operations in the workflow logs.
