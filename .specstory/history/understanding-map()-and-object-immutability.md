## Understanding .map() and Object Immutability (12/18/2024, 10:47:01 AM)

does .map mutate or return a brand new object?

_**Assistant**_

`.map()` returns a new array, but in your specific case there's a subtle issue: while `.map()` creates a new array, the objects inside that array are still references to the original objects. When you modify `c[key]` inside the `.map()`, you're actually mutating the original conversation objects.

Here's how to fix it to maintain true immutability:

```typescript:queries/useConversationListQuery.ts
// ... existing code ...
  const newConversations = previousConversationsData.map((c) => {
    if (c.topic === topic) {
      // Create a new object by spreading the original
      return {
        ...c,
        ...conversation
      };
    }
    return c;
  });
// ... existing code ...
```

This change:
1. Creates a new array (via `.map()`)
2. Creates new objects for the matching conversations (via spread operator)
3. Merges the updates cleanly without mutation
4. Removes the need for the `Object.keys().forEach()` loop
5. Eliminates the unsafe type casting with `as any`

The new version is both more concise and safer, maintaining true immutability throughout the operation.
