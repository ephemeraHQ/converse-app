## Fixing Infinite Loop in useEffect (1/14/2025, 3:15:02 PM)

_**User**_

i have a problem here so if i pass conversations in deps it seems that it does an inifnte loop... how can i fix this? but I still want to retrigger the useEffect when we have changes in the conversations

Let me help you fix the infinite loop issue. The problem likely occurs because the spam processing might be causing re-renders that trigger the effect again. Here's how we can fix it by comparing the conversation IDs:

```typescript:features/conversation-requests-list/conversation-requests-list.screen.tsx
const useRequestsConversations = () => {
  // ... existing code ...

  const [processedIds, setProcessedIds] = useState<Set<string>>(new Set());

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!conversations?.length) return;

    // Check if we've already processed these exact conversations
    const conversationIds = new Set(conversations.map(c => c.id));
    const hasAllBeenProcessed = Array.from(conversationIds).every(id => 
      processedIds.has(id)
    );
    
    if (hasAllBeenProcessed) return;

    async function processConversations(
      conversations: ConversationWithCodecsType[]
    ) {
      try {
        // ... existing processing code ...

        // After successful processing, update the processed IDs
        setProcessedIds(new Set(conversationIds));
      } catch (error) {
        captureErrorWithToast(error);
      }
    }

    processConversations(conversations);
  }, [conversations, processedIds]);

  return { likelyNotSpam, likelySpam };
};
```

Key changes made:
1. Added a `processedIds` state to keep track of which conversation IDs we've already processed
2. Added checks at the start of the effect to prevent unnecessary processing
3. Update `processedIds` after successful processing

This solution will:
- Only process conversations when they actually change (new ones added or removed)
- Prevent infinite loops by tracking which conversations we've already processed
- Still react to actual changes in the conversations data

The infinite loop was likely happening because setting the spam states was causing re-renders, which then triggered the effect again. This solution ensures we only process each set of conversations once while still maintaining reactivity to new changes.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type '(previousData: { isDeleted: boolean; isPinned: boolean; markedAsUnread: boolean; readUntil?: number | undefined; timestamp?: number | undefined; status?: "unread" | "read" | "deleted" | null | undefined; } | undefined) => Partial<...>' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Updater<{ isDeleted: boolean; isPinned: boolean; markedAsUnread: boolean; readUntil?: number | undefined; timestamp?: number | undefined; status?: "unread" | "read" | "deleted" | null | undefined; } | undefined, { ...; } | undefined>'.

        Types of property 'isDeleted' are incompatible.
          Type 'boolean | undefined' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
            Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'boolean'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The error occurs because we need to return a complete object, not a partial one. Here's the fix:

```typescript:queries/conversation-data-query.ts
    getConversationDataQueryOptions(args).queryKey,
    (previousData) => {
      if (!previousData) return data as IConversationDataQueryData;
      return {
        ...previousData,
        ...data,
      } satisfies IConversationDataQueryData;
    }
```

The fix ensures we return a complete `IConversationDataQueryData` object rather than a partial one, satisfying TypeScript's type requirements.
