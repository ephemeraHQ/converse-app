## Managing Conversation Data in React (12/12/2024, 3:27:20 PM)

_**User**_

Should i keep passing the "conversation" as props or reuse something like "const { data: conversation, isLoading: isLoadingConversation } =
    useConversationQuery(currentAccount, topic);"

---

_**Assistant**_

In this case, I would recommend reusing the `useConversationQuery` hook instead of passing the conversation prop down. Here's why:

1. The conversation data is already available through the context (`ConversationStoreProvider`)
2. It reduces prop drilling
3. It maintains consistency with how data is accessed throughout the component tree

Here's how I would refactor the code:

```typescript
// Remove the conversation prop from ComposerWrapper
const ComposerWrapper = memo(function ComposerWrapper() {
  const currentAccount = useCurrentAccount()!;
  const topic = useCurrentConversationTopic()!;
  
  const { data: conversation } = useConversationQuery(currentAccount, topic);
  
  const sendMessage = useSendMessage({
    conversation: conversation!,
  });
  
  return <Composer onSend={sendMessage} />;
});

// In the parent component, simplify the render
return (
  <ExternalWalletPickerContextProvider>
    <ConversationStoreProvider conversationId={conversation.id} topic={topic}>
      <MessageContextMenuStoreProvider>
        <ConversationComposerStoreProvider
          inputValue={textPrefill}
          storeName={topic}
        >
          <Messages conversation={conversation} />
          <ComposerWrapper /> {/* Remove conversation prop */}
          <KeyboardFiller />
          <MessageContextMenu />
          <MessageReactionsDrawer />
          <ExternalWalletPicker title="Choose a wallet" />
        </ConversationComposerStoreProvider>
      </MessageContextMenuStoreProvider>
    </ConversationStoreProvider>
  </ExternalWalletPickerContextProvider>
);
```

This approach:
- Reduces prop drilling
- Makes the component more self-contained
- Follows the pattern of using hooks to access data
- Is consistent with how other components in the codebase are accessing conversation data

The only potential downside would be if you're concerned about multiple queries to the same data, but since you're using React Query (based on the hook name), this should be handled efficiently through its caching mechanism.

but each time i need to make sure the conversation is there defined? like because when using useQuery it could be undefined for the first few seconds if we fetch it from server

---

_**Assistant**_

You make a good point! In this case, it's actually better to keep passing the `conversation` prop since:

1. The parent component already handles the loading state and existence checks
2. We avoid unnecessary null checks in child components
3. We ensure the child components only render when we have valid data
4. We prevent potential flash of loading states or undefined checks

So let's keep the current implementation:

```typescript:features/conversation/conversation.tsx
const ComposerWrapper = memo(function ComposerWrapper(props: {
  conversation: ConversationWithCodecsType;
}) {
  const { conversation } = props;
  const sendMessage = useSendMessage({
    conversation,
  });
  return <Composer onSend={sendMessage} />;
});
```

This is a good example where prop drilling is actually the better pattern because:
- The data is guaranteed to exist
- We maintain a clear data flow
- We avoid duplicate loading states
- We reduce complexity in child components

I apologize for my previous suggestion - sometimes the simpler solution is the better one!

What other strategy can i use

---

_**Assistant**_



Here are a few alternative strategies, ordered from most recommended to least:

1. **Create a Conversation Context**
```typescript:features/conversation/conversation.context.tsx
type IConversationContext = {
  conversation: ConversationWithCodecsType;
};

const ConversationContext = createContext<IConversationContext | null>(null);

export function ConversationProvider(props: { 
  conversation: ConversationWithCodecsType;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  const { conversation, children } = props;
  
  return (
    <ConversationContext.Provider value={{ conversation }}>
      {children}
    </ConversationProvider>
  );
}

export function useConversation() {
  const context = useContext(ConversationContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useConversation must be used within ConversationProvider');
  }
  return context.conversation;
}
```

Then use it like:
```typescript:features/conversation/conversation.tsx
// In parent
return (
  <ExternalWalletPickerContextProvider>
    <ConversationProvider conversation={conversation}>
      <ConversationStoreProvider conversationId={conversation.id} topic={topic}>
        {/* ... other providers ... */}
      </ConversationStoreProvider>
    </ConversationProvider>
  </ExternalWalletPickerContextProvider>
);

// In ComposerWrapper
const ComposerWrapper = memo(function ComposerWrapper() {
  const conversation = useConversation();
  const sendMessage = useSendMessage({ conversation });
  return <Composer onSend={sendMessage} />;
});
```

2. **Enhance existing ConversationStoreProvider**
```typescript:features/conversation/conversation.store-context.tsx
type IConversationStore = {
  conversation: ConversationWithCodecsType;
  topic: ConversationTopic;
  // ... other store values
};

// Add conversation to your existing store
export function ConversationStoreProvider(props: { 
  conversation: ConversationWithCodecsType;
  topic: ConversationTopic;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  // ... existing implementation
}

export function useConversationStore() {
  // Returns { conversation, topic, ... }
}
```

3. **Create a custom hook that handles loading state**
```typescript:features/conversation/hooks/useConversationSafe.ts
export function useConversationSafe(args: { 
  currentAccount: string; 
  topic: ConversationTopic;
}) {
  const { currentAccount, topic } = args;
  
  const { data: conversation, isLoading } = useConversationQuery(
    currentAccount,
    topic
  );

  if (!conversation && !isLoading) {
    throw new Error('Conversation not found');
  }

  // This will only return when conversation exists
  return conversation!;
}
```

Among these options, I would recommend the first approach (Context) because:
1. It's explicit about what data is available
2. It doesn't mix concerns with other stores
3. It's easy to test and mock
4. Components can easily access the conversation without prop drilling
5. The loading/error states are handled at a single point (parent component)
6. It follows React's composition pattern
7. It's easy to extend later if needed

The main tradeoff is adding another context, but given that this seems to be core data that many components need, it's worth it.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these approaches?
