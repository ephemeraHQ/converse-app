## Query Execution Behavior and Control (1/31/2025, 11:43:25 AM)

why does "getConversation" gets executed even tho i have enabledD:false

_**Assistant**_

The `enabled: false` setting in `getConversationQueryOptions` only prevents the query from automatically executing when the `useConversationQuery` hook is mounted. However, there are several other ways the query might be triggered:

1. Through `queryClient.ensureQueryData()` (which is used in your `getOrFetchConversation` function)
2. Through `queryClient.setQueryData()`
3. Through manual query invalidation
4. Through manual refetching

Looking at your code, the most likely cause is the `getOrFetchConversation` function. This function uses `ensureQueryData` which will execute the query if the data doesn't already exist in the cache, regardless of the `enabled` setting.

If you want to prevent the query from executing in these cases, you should either:

1. Use `getQueryData` instead of `ensureQueryData` if you only want to read from cache:

```typescript:queries/conversation-query.ts
// ... existing code ...

export function getOrFetchConversation(
  args: IGetConversationArgs & { caller: string }
) {
  // Only get from cache, don't fetch
  return queryClient.getQueryData(getConversationQueryOptions(args).queryKey);
}
```

2. Or add a check before using `ensureQueryData` if you want more control:

```typescript:queries/conversation-query.ts
// ... existing code ...

export function getOrFetchConversation(
  args: IGetConversationArgs & { caller: string }
) {
  const existingData = queryClient.getQueryData(
    getConversationQueryOptions(args).queryKey
  );
  
  if (existingData) {
    return existingData;
  }
  
  // Only fetch if we really need to
  return queryClient.ensureQueryData(getConversationQueryOptions(args));
}
```

Choose the approach that better fits your use case. If you never want the query to execute automatically, use approach #1. If you want to fetch only when there's no cached data, use approach #2.
