## Tracking Query Function Calls in React Query (1/22/2025, 4:58:41 PM)

_**User**_

is there a way with react-query to know every time we call a queryFn of a query?

Yes, there is! You can add an `onSuccess` handler in the `defaultOptions` of the `QueryClient` configuration to track every successful query function execution. Here's how you can modify the code:

```typescript:queries/queryClient.ts
// ... existing code ...
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      // ... existing code ...
      structuralSharing: false,
      onSuccess: (data, query) => {
        console.log('Query executed successfully:', {
          queryKey: query.queryKey,
          data,
        });
      },
      // ... existing code ...
    },
  },
// ... existing code ...
```

This will log every successful query execution. You can also use other lifecycle events like:

- `onSettled`: Called after either success or error
- `onError`: Already implemented in your `queryCache` for errors
- `onMutate`: Called before the mutation is executed

If you want more detailed tracking, you could also create a custom logger function:

```typescript:queries/queryClient.ts
// ... existing code ...
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      // ... existing code ...
      structuralSharing: false,
      onSettled: (data, error, query) => {
        const status = error ? 'error' : 'success';
        console.log(`Query ${status}:`, {
          queryKey: query.queryKey,
          data,
          error,
          timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
        });
      },
      // ... existing code ...
    },
  },
// ... existing code ...
```

Choose the approach that best fits your monitoring needs. The `onSettled` option is particularly useful as it captures both successful and failed query executions in one place.

Ah yes, you're right! In React Query v5, we can use the `queryFn` option in the `QueryClient` configuration to intercept all query function calls. Here's how to implement it:

```typescript:queries/queryClient.ts
// ... existing code ...
  defaultOptions: {
    queries: {
      // ... existing code ...
      queryFn: (context) => {
        console.log('Query function called:', {
          queryKey: context.queryKey,
          signal: context.signal,
          meta: context.meta,
        });
        
        // You must throw this error to indicate this is just a middleware
        throw new Error(
          'No queryFn provided for this query'
        );
      },
      // ... existing code ...
    },
  },
// ... existing code ...
```

This acts as a middleware that will be called before any actual query function. Note that you must throw an error at the end to indicate this is just a middleware, otherwise React Query will treat it as the actual query function.

This way you can track every time a query function is about to be executed, regardless of whether it succeeds or fails. The actual query function provided in `useQuery` will still be called after this middleware.
