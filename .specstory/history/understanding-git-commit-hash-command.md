_**Assistant**_

This command in the package.json scripts section is used to show the short hash of the latest commit in the git repository.

Let's break it down:
- `git show` - Shows information about git objects (commits, tags, etc.)
- `--format="%h"` - Formats the output to only show the abbreviated commit hash (usually first 7 characters)
- `--no-patch` - Suppresses showing the commit diff/patch

So when you run `yarn commit` or `npm run commit`, it will output something like `a1b2c3d` - which is the short version of the current commit's hash.

This is often useful for:
- Displaying version information in the app
- Debugging to quickly identify which code version is running
- CI/CD processes that need to reference specific commits

For example, if your latest commit has a full hash of `a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0`, running this command would show just `a1b2c3d`.
