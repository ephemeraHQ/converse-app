## Fixing TypeScript Type Assignment Error (11/27/2024, 9:25:56 AM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type '() => { topic: string; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Updater<ConversationWithCodecsType | undefined, ConversationWithCodecsType | undefined>'.
  Type '() => { topic: string; }' is not assignable to type '(input: ConversationWithCodecsType | undefined) => ConversationWithCodecsType | undefined'.
    Type '{ topic: string; }' is not assignable to type 'ConversationWithCodecsType | undefined'.
      Type '{ topic: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Dm<(TextCodec | ReactionCodec | ReadReceiptCodec | GroupUpdatedCodec | ReplyCodec | RemoteAttachmentCodec | StaticAttachmentCodec | TransactionReferenceCodec | CoinbaseMessagingPaymentCodec)[]>': client, id, createdAt, version, and 12 more.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the updater function you're providing to `setQueryData` is expected to return a `ConversationWithCodecsType` or `undefined`, but your function is returning an object that only contains a `topic` property. The `ConversationWithCodecsType` likely requires additional properties.

To resolve this, you need to ensure that the object returned by the updater function satisfies the `ConversationWithCodecsType`. Here's a concise fix:

```typescript:features/conversation/dm-conversation.screen.tsx
        () => ({
          topic: RANDOM_TOPIC,
          client: {}, // Add appropriate client object
          id: "RANDOM_ID", // Add a valid ID
          createdAt: new Date(), // Add a valid date
          version: "1.0", // Add a valid version
          // Add other required properties here
        } as ConversationWithCodecsType)
      );
```

### Explanation:
- **Add Required Properties**: Ensure that all required properties of `ConversationWithCodecsType` are included in the returned object.
- **Type Assertion**: Use `as ConversationWithCodecsType` to assert the type, ensuring TypeScript recognizes it as the correct type.

Make sure to replace placeholders like `client`, `id`, and `version` with actual values or logic that fits your application's context.
