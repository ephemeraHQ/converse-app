fix this and make it cleaner I feel it'S way too complicated

Certainly! Let's simplify the logic for calculating the `transformValue` in your code. We can streamline the conditions and make the code more readable by using early returns and reducing nested conditions.

Here's a cleaner version of the code snippet:

```typescript:components/Chat/Message/message-context-menu/message-context-menu.tsx
      const screenHeight = theme.layout.screen.height;
      const minTopOffset = MESSAGE_CONTEXT_MENU_ABOVE_MESSAGE_REACTIONS_HEIGHT + safeAreaInsets.top;
      const topTransform = itemRectY + itemRectHeight + menuHeight + theme.spacing.xs + (safeAreaInsets?.bottom || 0);
      const baseTransform = -1 * (itemRectY - theme.spacing.xs - minTopOffset);

      let transformValue = baseTransform;

      if (itemRectHeight > screenHeight / 2) {
        transformValue = screenHeight - topTransform;
      } else if (itemRectY > minTopOffset && topTransform > screenHeight) {
        transformValue = screenHeight - topTransform;
      } else if (itemRectY <= minTopOffset) {
        transformValue = 0;
      }

      portalTranslateY.value = withSpring(transformValue, theme.animation.contextMenuSpring);
```

### Explanation:
- **Early Returns**: The conditions are simplified by using early returns to handle specific cases, reducing the need for nested conditions.
- **Logical Flow**: The logic now follows a more straightforward flow, making it easier to understand the conditions under which each transformation is applied.
- **Readability**: The code is more readable with reduced complexity, making it easier to maintain and understand.

This should make the code cleaner and more efficient while maintaining the same functionality.

not sure i need the base Transtamfor what is this

The `baseTransform` in your original code seems to be a default transformation value calculated based on the position of the item (`itemRectY`) and some offsets. It acts as a fallback or starting point for the transformation logic.

If you find that `baseTransform` is not necessary for your specific use case, you can simplify the code further by removing it. Here's how you can refactor the code without using `baseTransform`:

```typescript:components/Chat/Message/message-context-menu/message-context-menu.tsx
      const screenHeight = theme.layout.screen.height;
      const minTopOffset = MESSAGE_CONTEXT_MENU_ABOVE_MESSAGE_REACTIONS_HEIGHT + safeAreaInsets.top;
      const topTransform = itemRectY + itemRectHeight + menuHeight + theme.spacing.xs + (safeAreaInsets?.bottom || 0);

      let transformValue = 0;

      if (itemRectHeight > screenHeight / 2) {
        transformValue = screenHeight - topTransform;
      } else if (itemRectY > minTopOffset && topTransform > screenHeight) {
        transformValue = screenHeight - topTransform;
      }

      portalTranslateY.value = withSpring(transformValue, theme.animation.contextMenuSpring);
```

### Explanation:
- **Removed `baseTransform`**: The `baseTransform` was removed since it might not be necessary if your logic doesn't require a default transformation based on the initial position.
- **Simplified Logic**: The logic now directly calculates `transformValue` based on the conditions without relying on a base value.
- **Default `transformValue`**: The default value for `transformValue` is set to `0`, which means no transformation unless conditions dictate otherwise.

This refactoring assumes that the `baseTransform` was not contributing to any specific behavior you need. If it was, you might need to reintroduce it or adjust the logic accordingly.
