## Direct Push to Main with Git PAT (1/15/2025, 9:11:08 AM)

_**User**_

here we are doing a PR to increment build number but can I instead just directly push the changes into "main" and with a git PAT to make sure it can push into main?

Yes, you can modify the workflow to directly push changes to the main branch instead of creating a PR. Here's how to update the `increment-build-numbers` job:

```yaml:.github/workflows/build-internal.yml
  increment-build-numbers:
    runs-on: warp-ubuntu-latest-x64-8x

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GIT_PAT }}  # Use PAT instead of GITHUB_TOKEN for push permissions

      - name: Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: .nvmrc
          cache: "yarn"
        env:
          SKIP_YARN_COREPACK_CHECK: "1"
      - run: corepack enable

      - name: Increment version numbers
        run: node scripts/build/incrementBuildNumbers.js

      - name: Commit and push changes
        run: |
          git config --global user.name 'github-actions[bot]'
          git config --global user.email 'github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com'
          git add .
          git commit -m "Increment build numbers [skip ci]"
          git push origin main
```

Key changes made:
1. Removed the PR creation step
2. Added `token: ${{ secrets.GIT_PAT }}` to the checkout step
3. Added a new step to commit and push changes directly to main
4. Added `[skip ci]` to commit message to prevent triggering another workflow run

Note: You'll need to:
1. Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo` scope
2. Add it as a repository secret named `GIT_PAT`
