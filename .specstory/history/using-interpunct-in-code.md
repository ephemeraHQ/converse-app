_**Assistant**_

Based on the Wikipedia article about interpuncts and your code, I can help ensure you're using the correct Unicode interpunct character. The standard Unicode MIDDLE DOT (U+00B7) is the recommended character to use.

Here's how to update your code:

```typescript:features/conversation-list/conversation-list-item/conversation-list-item-group.tsx
// ... existing code ...
    const subtitle =
      timeToShow && messageText ? `${timeToShow} \u00B7 ${messageText}` : "";
// ... existing code ...
```

There are three ways you could represent the interpunct:

1. Using Unicode escape sequence (recommended):
```typescript
`${timeToShow} \u00B7 ${messageText}`
```

2. Using the literal character:
```typescript
`${timeToShow} · ${messageText}`
```

3. Using HTML entity (not recommended for TypeScript string literals):
```typescript
`${timeToShow} &middot; ${messageText}`
```

I recommend using the Unicode escape sequence `\u00B7` because:
1. It's explicit and self-documenting
2. It avoids potential encoding issues
3. It's consistent with how special characters are typically handled in code
4. It ensures the character will be correctly displayed across different editors and systems

The current implementation using the literal `·` character works, but using `\u00B7` would be more robust and maintainable.
