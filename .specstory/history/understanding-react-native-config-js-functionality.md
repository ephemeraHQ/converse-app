## Understanding react-native.config.js Functionality (1/19/2025, 7:08:31 AM)

what does react-native.config.js at the root of my app will do?

_**Assistant**_

The `react-native.config.js` file at the root of your React Native project is a configuration file that helps customize how React Native CLI handles native dependencies and project settings. Here are its main purposes:

1. **Native Module Configuration**: It allows you to:
   - Configure platform-specific settings for native modules
   - Enable/disable specific platforms for certain dependencies
   - Customize how native modules are linked

2. **In Your Specific Case**: Your configuration is primarily used to:
   - Disable certain native modules for specific platforms where they aren't needed or supported
   - When a platform is set to `null`, it tells React Native CLI to skip linking that module for that platform

Let's break down your current configuration:

```javascript
"react-native-bootsplash": {
  platforms: {
    ios: null, // Disabled for iOS
  }
}
```
- This means `react-native-bootsplash` will only be linked for Android, not iOS

Similar patterns apply to other modules in your config:
- `expo-splash-screen` is disabled for Android
- `react-native-background-color` is disabled for iOS
- `react-native-system-navigation-bar` is disabled for iOS
- `walletsdk-ethos` is disabled for iOS
- `react-native-shared-group-preferences` is disabled for Android

This configuration is particularly useful when:
- You have platform-specific implementations
- Some modules are only needed on one platform
- You want to avoid conflicts between similar modules on different platforms
- You need to manage native dependencies differently per platform

The file is automatically read by React Native CLI during the build process and when running commands like `react-native link`.

but i don't use react-native CLI... I use expo

_**Assistant**_

Ah, that's an important distinction! If you're using Expo, you typically don't need the `react-native.config.js` file at all, especially if you're using the managed workflow.

Here's why:

1. **Expo Managed Workflow**:
   - Handles all native module configurations automatically
   - Doesn't use manual native module linking
   - Dependencies are managed through `app.json`/`app.config.js` and the Expo SDK

2. **Expo Development Builds**:
   - Even with development builds (previously called "bare workflow"), Expo handles native module configuration through its own system
   - Uses `app.json`/`app.config.js` for configuration
   - Uses plugins system for native code modifications

You can safely remove this file from your project if you're using Expo. Instead, any native module configurations should be handled through:

1. `app.json` or `app.config.js` for general configuration
2. Expo Config Plugins for more complex native code modifications
3. `expo-module-scripts` for custom native module development

If you're seeing this file in your project, it might be:
- A leftover from a previous non-Expo setup
- Added automatically by a package that assumes React Native CLI usage
- Added by mistake during project setup

You can safely delete this file as it won't have any effect on your Expo project.
