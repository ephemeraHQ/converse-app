## Renaming Job for Performance Testing (1/19/2025, 6:31:50 AM)

_**User**_

how should we call this job?

_**Assistant**_

Based on the file content and the fact that this job is running performance tests using `reassure`, I would suggest renaming the job from `performance-test` to `reassure` to be more specific and consistent with the tool being used.

Here's how to update the job name:

```yaml:.github/workflows/typescript.yml
// ... existing code ...
  reassure:
    runs-on: warp-ubuntu-latest-x64-8x
    steps:
// ... existing code ...
```

This name is:
1. More specific about what kind of performance testing we're doing
2. Directly maps to the tool being used (`yarn reassure`)
3. Follows the pattern of other job names in the file which are also named after their primary tool/purpose (tsc, lint, test)

It's more like a list of checks that are run in a PR. Like typescript tsc, lint, tests, etc

_**Assistant**_

In that case, I would suggest naming it `pr-checks` or `ci-checks` since it's a collection of checks that run on pull requests. Here's the update:

```yaml:.github/workflows/typescript.yml
// ... existing code ...
  pr-checks:
    runs-on: warp-ubuntu-latest-x64-8x
    steps:
// ... existing code ...
```

This name better reflects that this is part of the pull request verification process, alongside other checks like typescript, linting, and testing. It's also a common naming convention in CI workflows to use `pr-checks` or `ci-checks` for jobs that run a collection of verification steps.

Here are some alternative naming suggestions for the job, each with its own rationale:

1. `perf-checks`
   - Direct and indicates it's performance-related checks
   - Follows similar pattern to other check names
   - Short but descriptive

2. `performance-checks`
   - More explicit version of perf-checks
   - Very clear about its purpose
   - Consistent with full-word naming

3. `reassure-perf`
   - Combines the tool name with its purpose
   - Makes it clear which performance testing tool is being used
   - Similar to naming patterns like 'jest-test' or 'eslint-check'

4. `benchmark`
   - Simple and to the point
   - Common term for performance measurements
   - Easy to understand purpose

5. `perf-regression`
   - Indicates it's specifically checking for performance regressions
   - More specific about the type of performance testing
   - Describes what we're actually looking for

Here's how to implement any of these (example with first option):

```yaml:.github/workflows/typescript.yml
// ... existing code ...
  perf-checks:
    runs-on: warp-ubuntu-latest-x64-8x
    steps:
// ... existing code ...
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these options or suggest more alternatives?

It's more to make sure we don,t have any lint errors, and typecript errors or any tests that don,t pass

Ah, in that case, here are more appropriate naming suggestions that better reflect the validation/verification nature of these checks:

1. `validate`
   - Simple and clear purpose
   - Indicates we're validating the code quality
   - Common term in CI workflows

2. `code-quality`
   - Explicitly states what we're checking
   - Encompasses all types of checks (lint, types, tests)
   - Self-documenting

3. `verify`
   - Similar to validate but another common term
   - Indicates we're verifying the code is ready
   - Short and clear

4. `quality-checks`
   - Combines the purpose with the type of operation
   - Clear about what's being done
   - Follows similar pattern to other job names

5. `static-analysis`
   - Technical term for these types of checks
   - Covers both linting and type checking
   - Common industry term

Here's how to implement any of these (example with first option):

```yaml:.github/workflows/typescript.yml
// ... existing code ...
  validate:
    runs-on: warp-ubuntu-latest-x64-8x
    steps:
// ... existing code ...
```
