I'll add a brief comment explaining what the function does. Here's the update:

```typescript:features/search/search-by-conversation-membership/search-helpers.ts
// ... existing code ...

/**
 * Checks if a profile matches a search query by comparing the normalized query
 * against various profile identifiers (address, ENS, Lens, Farcaster, etc.)
 */
export function doesMemberProfileMatchQuery(args: {
  profile: IProfileSocials | null;
  normalizedQuery: string;
}): boolean {
  // ... existing code ...
}

// ... existing code ...
```

The added comment clearly describes that this function performs a search across multiple profile identifiers to find matches with the given query.
