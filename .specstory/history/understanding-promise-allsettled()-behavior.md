promise all settlted will make sure not to throw even if we have erorr in the function righ6

Yes, that's correct! `Promise.allSettled()` will wait for all promises to complete, regardless of whether they fulfill or reject, and it won't throw an error if any of the promises fail. This is different from `Promise.all()` which would reject immediately if any promise rejects.

Here's what `Promise.allSettled()` does:

1. It returns an array of objects describing the outcome of each promise
2. Each result object has:
   - `status`: either "fulfilled" or "rejected"
   - `value`: the resolved value (if fulfilled)
   - `reason`: the rejection reason (if rejected)

In your code, even if `prefetchInboxIdQuery` or `prefetchConversationsQuery` fails for one account, it will continue processing other accounts.

If you want to handle errors, you could modify the code like this:

```typescript:components/StateHandlers/HydrationStateHandler.tsx
      const results = await Promise.allSettled(
        accounts.map(async (account) => {
          const accountStartTime = new Date().getTime();
          logger.debug(
            `[Hydration] Fetching persisted conversation list for ${account}`
          );

          try {
            await prefetchInboxIdQuery({ account });
            await prefetchConversationsQuery({ account });
          } catch (error) {
            logger.error(`[Hydration] Error fetching data for ${account}:`, error);
          }

          const accountEndTime = new Date().getTime();
          logger.debug(
            `[Hydration] Done fetching persisted conversation list for ${account} in ${
              (accountEndTime - accountStartTime) / 1000
            } seconds`
          );
        })
      );
```

This way, you'll log any errors that occur during the prefetch operations while still ensuring the hydration process continues for all accounts.
