why do my teammate created this git action? Not sure to understand the purpose

_**Assistant**_

Let me explain the purpose of this GitHub Action. It's actually quite clever!

This workflow is called "Validate Code Quality (No checks)" and it's a "no-op" (no operation) workflow that runs when changes are made to files that **don't** need code quality checks. Let's break down when it runs:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main
      - release/*
    paths:
      - "**"              # Matches all files
      - "!**/*.ts"        # Excludes TypeScript files
      - "!**/*.tsx"       # Excludes TypeScript React files
      - "!package.json"   # Excludes package.json
```

The key is in the `paths` section:
- It matches all files (`**`)
- But explicitly excludes (`!`) TypeScript files, TypeScript React files, and package.json

This workflow exists for two main reasons:

1. **Status Check Requirements**: Many repositories require all status checks to pass before allowing merges. This workflow ensures that PRs that only modify non-code files (like documentation, images, or other assets) still get "green checkmarks" for code quality checks.

2. **Skip Unnecessary Checks**: There's no need to run TypeScript checks, linting, or tests when only non-code files are changed. This workflow provides a fast "pass" for those cases instead of running the full validation suite.

Each job (`tsc`, `lint`, `test`, `performance-test`) just echoes a message indicating nothing needs to be checked, making the workflow complete very quickly.

This is an optimization that:
- Saves CI/CD computing resources
- Speeds up PR processing for non-code changes
- Still maintains the required status checks for repository protection rules

Your team likely has another workflow file that runs the actual code quality checks when TypeScript files or package.json are modified.
