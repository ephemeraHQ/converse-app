I'll help you update the texts array with popular greetings in different languages. Here's the edit:

```typescript:features/conversation-list/conversation-list-loading.tsx
// ... existing code ...
            texts={["こんにちは", "你好", "안녕하세요", "مرحبا"]}
// ... existing code ...
```

This includes:
- こんにちは (Konnichiwa) - Japanese
- 你好 (Nǐ hǎo) - Mandarin Chinese
- 안녕하세요 (Annyeonghaseyo) - Korean
- مرحبا (Marhaba) - Arabic

These are some of the most widely spoken languages globally. The greetings will create an interesting and inclusive animation effect in your loading screen.

Here's an update with popular Western language greetings:

```typescript:features/conversation-list/conversation-list-loading.tsx
// ... existing code ...
            texts={["Hello", "Bonjour", "Ciao", "Hola"]}
// ... existing code ...
```

This includes:
- Hello - English
- Bonjour - French
- Ciao - Italian
- Hola - Spanish

These are some of the most common Western greetings that most users will be familiar with. They're also relatively short and simple, which works well for your animated text carousel.
