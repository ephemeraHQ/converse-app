_**Assistant**_

Looking at the dependencies in your package.json, you have the Tanstack Query (formerly React Query) packages that support query batching:

```json
{
  "@tanstack/query-persist-client-core": "^5.54.1",
  "@tanstack/query-sync-storage-persister": "^5.45.0", 
  "@tanstack/react-query": "^5.45.0",
  "@tanstack/react-query-persist-client": "^5.45.0"
}
```

Tanstack Query provides built-in support for batching queries through a few key features:

1. Query batching with `useQueries` hook - allows you to batch multiple queries together
2. Parallel queries execution
3. Query deduplication - automatically batches identical queries made within a small time window
4. Query retrying and caching

Here's a quick example of how you could use query batching:

```typescript
import { useQueries } from '@tanstack/react-query'

function YourComponent() {
  const results = useQueries({
    queries: [
      { queryKey: ['post', 1], queryFn: () => fetchPost(1) },
      { queryKey: ['post', 2], queryFn: () => fetchPost(2) },
      // ... more queries
    ],
  })
  
  // results will be an array of query results
}
```

The library will automatically optimize these queries by:
- Running them in parallel
- Deduplicating identical requests
- Caching results
- Managing loading/error states

You also have the persistence packages installed which allow you to persist query results across sessions if needed.
