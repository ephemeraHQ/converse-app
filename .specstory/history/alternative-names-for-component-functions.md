_**Assistant**_

Based on your request for alternative names for the three components, here are some suggestions that better describe their roles and responsibilities:

1. For `ConnectViaWallet`:
```typescript:components/Onboarding/ConnectViaWallet/ConnectViaWallet.tsx
export const WalletConnectionManager = memo(function WalletConnectionManager(
  props: IConnectViaWalletProps
) {
  // ... existing code ...
});
```

This name emphasizes that this component manages the overall wallet connection process.

2. For `WithStates`:
```typescript:components/Onboarding/ConnectViaWallet/ConnectViaWallet.tsx
const WalletConnectionStateHandler = memo(function WalletConnectionStateHandler({ address }: { address: string }) {
  // ... existing code ...
});
```

This name highlights that this component handles different states of the wallet connection process.

3. For `Main`:
```typescript:components/Onboarding/ConnectViaWallet/ConnectViaWallet.tsx
const WalletConnectionUI = memo(function WalletConnectionUI() {
  // ... existing code ...
});
```

This name indicates that this component is responsible for rendering the user interface for the wallet connection process.

These new names provide more clarity about each component's purpose within the wallet connection flow. They maintain the same structure and functionality while offering more descriptive titles.
