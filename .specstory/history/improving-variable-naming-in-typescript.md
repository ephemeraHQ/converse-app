## Improving Variable Naming in TypeScript (1/13/2025, 9:47:46 AM)

is "groupMembersData" good

_**Assistant**_

Based on the code style guide and TypeScript best practices, I'd suggest renaming `groupMembersData` to something more descriptive. Since this is a hook that returns information about group members, we should make the variable name more precise.

Here's the suggested change:

```typescript:hooks/use-current-account-group-members-info.ts
// ... existing code ...
  return {
    memberData: members, // renamed from groupMembersData
  };
```

And rename the `groupMembersData` variable earlier in the code to `members`:

```typescript:hooks/use-current-account-group-members-info.ts
  const members = useMemo(
    () =>
      socialsData
        .map(({ data: socials }, index): IMemberInfo | null =>
          // ... existing code ...
        )
        .filter(Boolean) as IMemberInfo[],
    [memberInboxIds, socialsData]
  );
```

Reasons for the change:
1. The "Data" suffix is redundant since it's clear from the type that this is data
2. The "group" prefix is redundant since we're already in a hook specifically about group members
3. The shorter name "members" is more concise while still being clear about what it contains
4. It follows the principle of clean, readable code without unnecessary verbosity

The returned property name `memberData` could also be simplified to just `members`, but that would be a breaking change for any components using this hook, so I kept it as is unless you want to update all usages.
