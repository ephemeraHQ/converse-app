## Error Handling in Batched Queries (1/14/2025, 10:39:10 AM)

_**User**_

what happens if we get an error in the await getTopics in the batcher, will it put an error in our useQuery?

---

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the code, if `getTopics()` throws an error in the batched fetcher, it will indeed propagate to the `useQuery` hook. Here's why:

1. The error will bubble up through the Promise.all() in the fetcher
2. This will cause the batched fetch operation to fail
3. The `@yornaath/batshit` library will propagate this error back to the individual query
4. React Query will then handle this error as it normally would, setting the query into an error state

However, we should probably handle this error more gracefully. Here's how we can modify the code:

```typescript:queries/use-conversation-data-query.ts
const batchedGetConversationTopicData = create({
  scheduler: windowScheduler(50),
  resolver: (items, query) => {
    const match = items.find(
      (item) =>
        `${query.account}-${query.topic}` === `${item.account}-${item.topic}`
    );
    if (!match) return undefined;
    // Destructure to remove account and topic from the result
    const { account, topic, ...rest } = match;
    return rest;
  },
  fetcher: async (args: IArgs[]) => {
    const accountGroups = args.reduce(
      (groups, arg) => {
        groups[arg.account] = groups[arg.account] || [];
        groups[arg.account].push(arg);
        return groups;
      },
      {} as Record<string, IArgs[]>
    );

    const results = await Promise.all(
      Object.entries(accountGroups).map(async ([account, groupArgs]) => {
        try {
          const conversationsData = await getTopics({
            account,
          });

          return groupArgs.map((arg) => ({
            ...conversationsData[arg.topic],
            account,
            topic: arg.topic,
          }));
        } catch (error) {
          // Log the error
          logger.error(
            `Failed to fetch topics for account ${account}:`,
            error
          );
          // Return empty results for this account's queries
          return groupArgs.map((arg) => ({
            account,
            topic: arg.topic,
          }));
        }
      })
    );

    return results.flat();
  },
});
```

The changes:
1. Added a try/catch block around the `getTopics` call
2. If there's an error, we:
   - Log it for debugging
   - Return a minimal object with just the account and topic, allowing the batch operation to continue for other accounts
   - This way, individual queries will get empty data instead of failing completely

This makes the system more resilient by preventing a single account's error from breaking queries for other accounts in the same batch.
