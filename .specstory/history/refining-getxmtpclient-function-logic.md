## Refining getXmtpClient Function Logic (1/28/2025, 11:10:46 AM)

I feel we could do a better job with getXMTP client . Don't need to have initlizeNewClient separatly. but basically it should just be if we have existing in "xmtpClientByAccount" return that. It might be a promise or the client. otherwise just return the buildXmtpCleint ?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help simplify the `getXmtpClient` function by removing the `initializeNewClient` function and making the logic more straightforward. Here's the suggested update:

```typescript:utils/xmtpRN/client/client.ts
// ... existing code ...

export async function getXmtpClient({
  account,
  inboxId,
}: {
  account: string;
  inboxId: InboxId;
}): Promise<ConverseXmtpClientType> {
  const cleanAccount = getCleanEthAddress(account);

  // Return existing client or promise if available
  if (cleanAccount in xmtpClientByAccount) {
    return xmtpClientByAccount[cleanAccount];
  }

  try {
    logger.debug("[XmtpRN] Getting client from address");
    const clientPromise = buildXmtpClient({
      address: cleanAccount,
      inboxId,
    });
    
    // Store the promise in the cache
    xmtpClientByAccount[cleanAccount] = clientPromise;
    
    const client = await clientPromise;
    logger.info(`[XmtpRN] Instantiated client for ${client.address}`);
    
    // Update cache with resolved client
    xmtpClientByAccount[cleanAccount] = client;
    return client;
  } catch (error) {
    delete xmtpClientByAccount[cleanAccount];
    throw error;
  }
}

// ... existing code ...
```

The changes:
1. Removed the `initializeNewClient` function as it was an unnecessary abstraction
2. Removed the check for active clients since it could cause an infinite loop
3. Simplified the logic to either return an existing client/promise or create a new one
4. Maintained the error handling and cleanup in case of failure
5. Added proper logging for debugging

The function now has a clearer flow: check cache → create new client → update cache → return client.
