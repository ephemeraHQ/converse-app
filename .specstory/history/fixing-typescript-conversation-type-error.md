## Fixing TypeScript Conversation Type Error (11/27/2024, 2:49:59 PM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type '{ client: ConverseXmtpClientType; state: "allowed"; id: ConversationId; createdAt: number; version: ConversationVersion.GROUP; ... 6 more ...; lastMessage?: DecodedMessage<...> | undefined; } | { ...; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'ConversationWithCodecsType'.
  Type '{ client: ConverseXmtpClientType; state: "allowed"; id: ConversationId; createdAt: number; version: ConversationVersion.GROUP; ... 6 more ...; lastMessage?: DecodedMessage<...> | undefined; }' is not assignable to type 'ConversationWithCodecsType'.
    Type '{ client: ConverseXmtpClientType; state: "allowed"; id: ConversationId; createdAt: number; version: ConversationVersion.GROUP; ... 6 more ...; lastMessage?: DecodedMessage<...> | undefined; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Group<(TextCodec | ReactionCodec | ReadReceiptCodec | GroupUpdatedCodec | ReplyCodec | RemoteAttachmentCodec | StaticAttachmentCodec | TransactionReferenceCodec | CoinbaseMessagingPaymentCodec)[]>': memberInboxIds, creatorInboxId, send, prepareMessage, and 38 more.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error message indicates that the object being passed to `setConversationQueryData` is missing several properties required by the `ConversationWithCodecsType`. To resolve this, ensure that all required properties are included in the object. Here's a concise fix:

```typescript:hooks/useGroupConsent.ts
// ... existing code ...
            ...previousConversation,
            client: (await getXmtpClient(account)) as ConverseXmtpClientType,
            state: "allowed",
            memberInboxIds: previousConversation.memberInboxIds, // Ensure this property is included
            creatorInboxId: previousConversation.creatorInboxId, // Ensure this property is included
            send: previousConversation.send, // Ensure this property is included
            prepareMessage: previousConversation.prepareMessage, // Ensure this property is included
            // Add any other missing properties here
          });
// ... existing code ...
```

### Explanation

- **Ensure All Required Properties**: The error suggests that properties like `memberInboxIds`, `creatorInboxId`, `send`, and `prepareMessage` are missing. Make sure these and any other required properties are included in the object being passed to `setConversationQueryData`.
- **Use Previous Data**: If these properties exist in `previousConversation`, you can directly use them to fill in the missing fields. If not, you may need to initialize them appropriately based on your application's logic.
