## Finding EthAddress from InboxId (2/19/2025, 8:42:47 AM)

_**User**_

look in @Codebase  and tell me if there's a function that given an inboxId will give me an EthAddress

---

Yes, based on the codebase there are a couple of ways to get an Ethereum address from an InboxId:

1. The most direct way appears to be through the `xmtpClientInboxIdToAddressMap` in the `MultiInboxClient` class:

```typescript:features/multi-inbox/multi-inbox.client.ts
private get xmtpClientInboxIdToAddressMap() {
  return useAccountsStore.getState().senders.reduce((acc, sender) => {
    acc[sender.inboxId] = sender.ethereumAddress;
    return acc;
  }, {} as { [inboxId: string]: string });
}
```

2. You can also get it from the `senders` array in the `useAccountsStore`:

```typescript:features/multi-inbox/multi-inbox.store.ts
const senders = useAccountsStore.getState().senders;
const sender = senders.find(sender => sender.inboxId === inboxId);
const ethereumAddress = sender?.ethereumAddress;
```

For your use case in `profile-other.tsx`, I would recommend adding a lookup using the `useAccountsStore` since it's already being used in the codebase. Here's how you could modify your code:

```typescript:features/profiles/profile-other.tsx
// ... existing imports
import { useAccountsStore } from "@/features/multi-inbox/multi-inbox.store";

export const ProfileOther = memo(function (props: { inboxId: InboxId }) {
  const { inboxId } = props;
  const { theme } = useAppTheme();
  
  useProfileOtherScreenHeader({ inboxId });

  const senders = useAccountsStore.getState().senders;
  const ethAddress = senders.find(sender => sender.inboxId === inboxId)?.ethereumAddress || inboxId;

  const { data: profile } = useSocialProfilesForAddress({
    ethAddress,
  });

  return (
    <Screen preset="fixed" backgroundColor={theme.colors.background.surface}>
      <ProfileSection>
        <ProfileContactCard inboxId={inboxId} />
      </ProfileSection>

      {profile && <ProfileSocialsNames socials={profile[0]} />}
    </Screen>
  );
});
```

This approach:
1. Uses the existing store
2. Falls back to using the inboxId as the ethAddress if no mapping is found
3. Maintains the existing functionality while adding the address lookup

no because that's for the current account, i need a better way interacting wit hthe XMTP client

_**Assistant**_

Looking at the codebase, there are a couple of ways to get an Ethereum address from an InboxId using the XMTP client:

1. The `MultiInboxClient` class has a private `xmtpClientInboxIdToAddressMap` property that maps InboxIds to Ethereum addresses. We could add a public method to access this:

```typescript:features/multi-inbox/multi-inbox.client.ts
export class MultiInboxClient {
  // ... existing code ...

  public getEthereumAddressFromInboxId(inboxId: InboxId): string | undefined {
    return this.xmtpClientInboxIdToAddressMap[inboxId];
  }
}
```

Then you could use it in your component like this:

```typescript:features/profiles/profile-other.tsx
export const ProfileOther = memo(function (props: { inboxId: InboxId }) {
  const { inboxId } = props;
  const { theme } = useAppTheme();
  
  useProfileOtherScreenHeader({ inboxId });

  const ethAddress = MultiInboxClient.instance.getEthereumAddressFromInboxId(inboxId) || inboxId;

  const { data: profile } = useSocialProfilesForAddress({
    ethAddress,
  });

  return (
    <Screen preset="fixed" backgroundColor={theme.colors.background.surface}>
      <ProfileSection>
        <ProfileContactCard inboxId={inboxId} />
      </ProfileSection>

      {profile && <ProfileSocialsNames socials={profile[0]} />}
    </Screen>
  );
});
```

This approach:
1. Uses the existing XMTP client mapping
2. Maintains encapsulation by adding a proper accessor method
3. Falls back to using the inboxId if no mapping is found
4. Is more reliable than using the store directly since the XMTP client maintains the authoritative mapping

look in @XMTP if you c an find anything there

Yes, looking at the XMTP documentation, I found several relevant pieces of information:

1. XMTP maintains a mapping between InboxIds and Ethereum addresses as part of its identity system. From the docs:

```
XMTP allows those users to be contacted through a single inbox for all of those identities by associating these multiple wallets with a single Inbox ID.
```

2. The XMTP client provides methods to get member addresses from InboxIds. From the groups documentation:

```typescript
// Get addresses for members
const members = await group.members();
const addresses = members.map((member) => member.addresses);
```

3. The XMTP client maintains an "inbox log" that tracks the relationship between wallets and InboxIds:

```
XMTP maintains an _inbox log_.  
- The inbox log has a list of all identity actions affecting the inbox.
```

Based on this, I would suggest modifying the code to use the XMTP client's built-in functionality to get the Ethereum address. Here's how we can update the code:

```typescript:features/multi-inbox/multi-inbox.client.ts
import { InboxId } from "@xmtp/react-native-sdk";

export class MultiInboxClient {
  // ... existing code ...

  public async getEthereumAddressFromInboxId(inboxId: InboxId): Promise<string | undefined> {
    // First try the local map
    const cachedAddress = this.xmtpClientInboxIdToAddressMap[inboxId];
    if (cachedAddress) {
      return cachedAddress;
    }

    // If not found in local map, try getting it from the XMTP client
    try {
      // Get any client since they all have access to the same network data
      const anyClient = Object.values(this.ethereumSmartWalletAddressToXmtpInboxClientMap)[0];
      if (!anyClient) {
        return undefined;
      }

      const members = await anyClient.conversations.members();
      const member = members.find(m => m.inboxId === inboxId);
      if (!member) {
        return undefined;
      }

      // XMTP stores addresses in an array since one InboxId can be associated with multiple addresses
      return member.addresses[0];
    } catch (error) {
      logger.warn(`Failed to get Ethereum address for InboxId ${inboxId}`, error);
      return undefined;
    }
  }
}
```

This implementation:

1. First checks the local cache map
2. If not found, uses the XMTP client's built-in functionality to look up the address
3. Falls back gracefully if the lookup fails
4. Uses TypeScript types from the XMTP SDK
5. Follows the protocol's design for identity resolution
