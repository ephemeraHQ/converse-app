_**Assistant**_

This error typically occurs when the ESLint import resolver for TypeScript isn't properly configured. Let's fix the configuration in your ESLint config file.

Here's the update needed:

```mjs:eslint.config.mjs
// ... existing code ...
    settings: {
      "import/resolver": {
        // Replace the simple boolean with a configuration object
        typescript: {
          alwaysTryTypes: true,
          project: './tsconfig.json'
        },
        node: true,
      },
      react: {
        version: "detect",
      },
    },
// ... existing code ...
```

The issue is that we're using a simple `typescript: true` in the import resolver settings. Instead, we should provide a proper configuration object for the TypeScript resolver.

This change:
1. Explicitly tells the resolver where to find your TypeScript configuration
2. Enables `alwaysTryTypes` to ensure it always attempts to resolve TypeScript types
3. Maintains better compatibility with the import plugin

Make sure you also have `@types/eslint-import-resolver-typescript` installed in your dev dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/eslint-import-resolver-typescript
# or
yarn add -D @types/eslint-import-resolver-typescript
```
