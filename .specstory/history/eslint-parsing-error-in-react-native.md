## ESLint Parsing Error in React Native (11/6/2024, 2:57:29 PM)

_**User**_

why doing yarn lint i have this error?


Error while parsing /Users/thierryskoda/Programming/converse-app/node_modules/react-native/index.js
Line 14, column 29: ';' expected.
`parseForESLint` from parser `context.languageOptions.parser` is invalid and will just be ignored

---

_**Assistant**_

This error typically occurs when ESLint is trying to parse React Native's code with TypeScript parser settings. Here's how to fix it:

```javascript:eslint.config.mjs
export default [
  {
    // First config for TypeScript files
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    // ... existing TypeScript config ...
  },
  {
    // Add new config for JavaScript files
    files: ["**/*.{js,jsx}"],
    ignores: ["dist/", "node_modules/", "vendor/"],
    languageOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: "latest",
      sourceType: "module",
    },
    plugins: {
      react: pluginReact,
      import: pluginImport,
      "react-hooks": pluginReactHooks,
      "react-native": fixupPluginRules(pluginReactNative),
    },
    rules: {
      ...pluginReact.configs["recommended"].rules,
      ...pluginImport.configs["recommended"].rules,
      ...pluginReactHooks.configs["recommended"].rules,
      ...pluginReactNative.configs["all"].rules,
    },
    settings: {
      react: {
        version: "detect",
      },
    },
  },
  // ... rest of your configs ...
]
```

The issue is that your ESLint configuration is trying to use the TypeScript parser for all files, including JavaScript files in node_modules. The fix adds a separate configuration for JavaScript files without the TypeScript parser. This way:

1. TypeScript files (`.ts`, `.tsx`) will use the TypeScript parser
2. JavaScript files (`.js`, `.jsx`) will use the default ESLint parser
3. The configuration maintains all your React and React Native specific rules

This should resolve the parsing error you're seeing with the React Native package.

but the files in node_modules should be ignored anyway no?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you're absolutely right! The `node_modules` directory should be ignored by ESLint. Let's check your configuration to make sure it's properly set up.

The issue might be that the `ignores` pattern needs to be at the root level of the configuration. Here's the fix:

```javascript:eslint.config.mjs
export default [
  {
    // Add ignores at the root level
    ignores: ["**/node_modules/**", "dist/**", "vendor/**"],
  },
  {
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    // Remove ignores from here since it's now at root level
    languageOptions: {
      parser: parserTypescript,
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: "latest",
        sourceType: "module",
      },
    },
    // ... rest of your TypeScript config
  },
  // ... rest of your configs
];
```

The key differences are:
1. Added a separate config object at the start just for ignores
2. Updated the ignore patterns to use globstar (`**`) for better directory matching
3. Removed the redundant ignores from the TypeScript config

This should properly ignore the `node_modules` directory and prevent ESLint from trying to parse those files at all.

still the same rorr

---

_**Assistant**_

Let's try a different approach. The issue might be related to how ESLint flat config handles ignores. Here are two potential solutions:

1. First, try using `ignores` with more specific patterns:

```javascript:eslint.config.mjs
export default [
  {
    ignores: [
      // More specific ignore patterns
      "**/node_modules/**/*",
      "**/dist/**/*",
      "**/vendor/**/*",
      "node_modules/**",
      ".yarn/**",
      "build/**",
    ],
  },
  // ... rest of your config
];
```

2. If that doesn't work, we can try using the `ignore` property instead of `ignores`:

```javascript:eslint.config.mjs
export default [
  {
    ignore: true,
    files: [
      "**/node_modules/**",
      "**/dist/**",
      "**/vendor/**",
      "node_modules/**",
      ".yarn/**",
      "build/**",
    ],
  },
  // ... rest of your config
];
```

Also, could you try running ESLint with the `--debug` flag to get more information about what's happening?

```bash
yarn lint --debug
```

This will help us see exactly which files ESLint is trying to parse and why it might be including node_modules despite the ignore patterns.

_**Assistant**_

Based on the ESLint documentation, let's fix your ignore patterns. The issue might be that the patterns need to be more specific and properly formatted for flat config. Here's the corrected version:

```javascript:eslint.config.mjs
export default [
  {
    // Global ignores should be in a separate config object with only 'ignores'
    ignores: [
      "**/node_modules/**/*",    // More specific pattern for node_modules
      "**/dist/**/*",            // More specific pattern for dist
      "**/vendor/**/*",          // More specific pattern for vendor
      ".git/**",                 // Explicitly ignore .git
    ]
  },
  {
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    // Remove ignores from here since they're now global
    languageOptions: {
      parser: parserTypescript,
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: "latest",
        sourceType: "module",
      },
    },
    // ... rest of your config
  },
  // ... rest of your configs
];
```

Key changes:
1. Moved ignores to a separate config object at the start
2. Made the patterns more specific using `**/*` to properly match all files in those directories
3. Removed the ignores from the TypeScript config since they're now global

According to the documentation:
- Global `ignores` patterns should be in a separate config object with no other keys
- The patterns are evaluated relative to the `eslint.config.mjs` file
- The pattern `**/node_modules/**/*` is more thorough than just `node_modules/` as it will match node_modules directories at any depth

This should properly ignore the node_modules directory and prevent the parsing error you're seeing.

Let's try a different approach. Since the error is specifically about parsing React Native's index.js file, we can try to exclude it more explicitly. Also, we should ensure JavaScript files are parsed with the correct parser.

```javascript:eslint.config.mjs
export default [
  {
    ignores: [
      "**/node_modules/**/*",
      "**/dist/**/*",
      "**/vendor/**/*",
      ".git/**",
    ],
  },
  {
    // Add JavaScript files config first
    files: ["**/*.{js,jsx}"],
    languageOptions: {
      // Remove TypeScript parser for JS files
      ecmaVersion: "latest",
      sourceType: "module",
    },
    plugins: {
      react: pluginReact,
      import: pluginImport,
      "react-hooks": pluginReactHooks,
      "react-native": fixupPluginRules(pluginReactNative),
    },
    // ... rest of plugins and rules but without TypeScript specific ones
  },
  {
    // TypeScript config comes after
    files: ["**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    languageOptions: {
      parser: parserTypescript,
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: "latest",
        sourceType: "module",
      },
    },
    // ... rest of your TypeScript config
  },
  // ... rest of your configs
];
```

Could you also try running ESLint with the `--print-config` flag on the problematic file to see what configuration is being applied?

```bash
yarn eslint --print-config node_modules/react-native/index.js
```

This will help us understand which configuration is being applied to that specific file and why it might not be getting ignored properly.

the print config prints "undefined"

MAybe it's where i call. "yarn lint" ""lint": "eslint . --max-warnings 420","

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah, I see the issue! When using ESLint flat config, the CLI command needs to be updated. The `.` pattern isn't handled the same way as in traditional ESLint config. Let's modify your package.json script:

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    // Change this line
    "lint": "eslint \"**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}\" --max-warnings 420",
    // ... other scripts
  }
}
```

The explicit glob pattern `"**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}"` tells ESLint exactly which files to look at, while still respecting the ignore patterns in your config.

This should:
1. Properly respect the ignore patterns for node_modules
2. Only lint JavaScript and TypeScript files
3. Still maintain your max warnings limit

Try running `yarn lint` again with this updated script.

_**User**_

but is there a way that I can do "eslint" and it wil ljust take the files I ahve in my config?

---

_**Assistant**_



Yes! When using ESLint flat config, you can use the `--cache` flag without any file pattern, and ESLint will use the `files` patterns from your config. Here's how to update your package.json:

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "eslint --cache --max-warnings 420"
  }
}
```

This approach:
1. Uses the `files` patterns from your eslint.config.mjs
2. Respects your ignore patterns
3. Uses caching for better performance
4. Maintains your max warnings limit

The `--cache` flag is recommended here because it not only improves performance but also helps ESLint properly recognize the configuration patterns. Without a specific file pattern, ESLint will use the `files` patterns from your config to determine which files to lint.

even "npx eslint --ignore-pattern "./node_modules/*"" gives me

Let's try a more aggressive approach to fix this. The issue seems to be that ESLint is still trying to parse node_modules despite our ignore patterns. Let's modify the config to be more explicit:

```javascript:eslint.config.mjs
export default [
  {
    // Explicit ignores at root level
    ignores: ["node_modules/**", "node_modules"],
  },
  {
    // Only target files in your src directory (or wherever your source code is)
    files: ["src/**/*.{ts,tsx}", "app/**/*.{ts,tsx}", "components/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    languageOptions: {
      parser: parserTypescript,
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: "latest",
        sourceType: "module",
      },
    },
    // ... rest of your config
  },
  // ... other configs
];
```

And in your package.json:

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=true eslint --max-warnings 420"
  }
}
```

The key changes are:
1. Added `ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=true` to ensure flat config is used
2. Made the `files` patterns more specific to only target your source code
3. Simplified the ignore pattern for node_modules
4. Removed the catch-all pattern and instead explicitly listed directories to lint

This should prevent ESLint from even attempting to look at node_modules. Let me know if this works better!

---

_**User**_

but "yarn eslint --print-config node_modules/react-native/index.js" prints "undefined" 

---

_**Assistant**_



Ah, that's an important clue! If `--print-config` returns `undefined`, it means ESLint isn't finding a valid configuration for that file. The error might be coming from a different part of the process.

Let's try to debug this by:

1. First, rename your `eslint.config.mjs` to `eslint.config.js` (some versions have issues with .mjs)

2. Then modify the config to be extra explicit about what NOT to parse:

```javascript:eslint.config.js
export default [
  {
    // First config only for ignores
    ignores: ["**/node_modules/**"],
  },
  {
    // Explicitly state which files we WANT to lint
    files: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx}", "./app/**/*.{ts,tsx}", "./components/**/*.{ts,tsx}"],
    // ... rest of your typescript config
  }
];
```

3. And in package.json, let's be very explicit:

```json:package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint": "ESLINT_USE_FLAT_CONFIG=true TIMING=1 DEBUG=eslint:* eslint"
  }
}
```

The `TIMING=1` and `DEBUG=eslint:*` flags will give us more information about what's happening.

Could you run this and share what debug output you get? This will help us understand why ESLint is still trying to parse node_modules even though the config for that file is undefined.
