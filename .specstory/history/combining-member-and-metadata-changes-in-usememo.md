## Combining Member and Metadata Changes in useMemo (11/14/2024, 11:27:09 AM)

_**User**_

possible to make all inside the useMemo?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, we can combine both the member changes processing and metadata changes into a single `useMemo`. Here's how to refactor it:

```typescript:components/Chat/ChatGroupUpdatedMessage.tsx
  const membersActions = useMemo(() => {
    const actions: { content: string }[] = [];

    // Process member changes
    const processMemberChanges = (
      members: { inboxId: string }[],
      actionKey: TxKeyPath
    ) => {
      members.forEach((member) => {
        const socials = mappedSocials[member.inboxId as InboxId]?.[0];
        const address = socials?.address;
        if (!socials || !address) return;
        const readableName = getPreferredName(socials, address);
        actions.push({
          content: translate(actionKey, { name: readableName }),
        });
      });
    };

    // Process added and removed members
    processMemberChanges(content.membersAdded, "group_member_joined");
    processMemberChanges(content.membersRemoved, "group_member_left");

    // Process metadata changes
    const metadataActions = content.metadataFieldsChanged
      .map((entry) => {
        let txKey: TxKeyPath;
        let txParams: Record<string, string>;

        switch (entry.fieldName) {
          case "group_name":
            txKey = "group_name_changed_to";
            txParams = { newValue: entry.newValue };
            break;
          case "group_image_url_square":
            txKey = "group_photo_changed";
            txParams = {};
            break;
          case "description":
            txKey = "group_description_changed";
            txParams = { newValue: entry.newValue };
            break;
          default:
            return null;
        }

        return {
          content: translate(txKey, txParams),
        };
      })
      .filter(Boolean);

    return [...actions, ...metadataActions];
  }, [content, mappedSocials]); // Added mappedSocials to dependencies
```

Key changes:
- Combined both operations into a single `useMemo`
- Created a single array of actions that includes both member changes and metadata changes
- Moved the `processMemberChanges` function inside the `useMemo`
- Added `mappedSocials` to the dependency array since it's used inside the memo
- The result is a single array containing all actions in the order they occurred

Do we really need the procesmemberChanges?

---

_**Assistant**_

No, we can simplify it by processing the members directly in the `useMemo`. Here's the cleaner version:

```typescript:components/Chat/ChatGroupUpdatedMessage.tsx
  const membersActions = useMemo(() => {
    const actions: { content: string }[] = [];

    // Process added members
    content.membersAdded.forEach((member) => {
      const socials = mappedSocials[member.inboxId as InboxId]?.[0];
      const address = socials?.address;
      if (!socials || !address) return;
      
      actions.push({
        content: translate("group_member_joined", { 
          name: getPreferredName(socials, address) 
        }),
      });
    });

    // Process removed members
    content.membersRemoved.forEach((member) => {
      const socials = mappedSocials[member.inboxId as InboxId]?.[0];
      const address = socials?.address;
      if (!socials || !address) return;
      
      actions.push({
        content: translate("group_member_left", { 
          name: getPreferredName(socials, address) 
        }),
      });
    });

    // Process metadata changes
    const metadataActions = content.metadataFieldsChanged
      .map((entry) => {
        let txKey: TxKeyPath;
        let txParams: Record<string, string>;

        switch (entry.fieldName) {
          case "group_name":
            txKey = "group_name_changed_to";
            txParams = { newValue: entry.newValue };
            break;
          case "group_image_url_square":
            txKey = "group_photo_changed";
            txParams = {};
            break;
          case "description":
            txKey = "group_description_changed";
            txParams = { newValue: entry.newValue };
            break;
          default:
            return null;
        }

        return {
          content: translate(txKey, txParams),
        };
      })
      .filter(Boolean);

    return [...actions, ...metadataActions];
  }, [content, mappedSocials]);
```

This version:
- Removes the unnecessary `processMemberChanges` function
- Processes members directly in the `useMemo`
- Is more straightforward to read and understand
- Has the same functionality but with less code complexity
