## Fixing Conditional React Hook Usage (1/7/2025, 2:49:00 PM)

React Hook "useHandleDeleteGroup" is called conditionally. React Hooks must be called in the exact same order in every component render.

I'll help fix the conditional Hook usage issue. The problem is that we're calling the hooks `useHandleDeleteGroup` and `useHandleDeleteDm` inside a ternary operator, which violates React's rules of hooks. We need to call these hooks unconditionally at the top level.

Here's how to fix it:

```typescript:features/conversation-list/components/conversation-list-item-context-menu/conversation-list-item-context-menu.utils.tsx
export function useConversationContextMenuDeleteItem(args: {
  conversationTopic: ConversationTopic;
}): IUseContextMenuItem {
  const { conversationTopic } = args;
  const { theme } = useAppTheme();
  const conversation = useConversationListConversation(conversationTopic);
  
  // Call hooks unconditionally
  const handleDeleteGroup = useHandleDeleteGroup(conversation);
  const handleDeleteDm = useHandleDeleteDm(conversation);

  // Then use the results in the conditional logic
  const handleDeleteFn = conversation
    ? isConversationGroup(conversation)
      ? handleDeleteGroup
      : handleDeleteDm
    : () => null;

  return {
    actionKey: "delete",
    // ... rest of the return object stays the same ...
  } satisfies IUseContextMenuItem;
}
```

The key changes are:
1. Moved the hook calls to the top level of the component
2. Store their results in variables
3. Use those variables in the conditional logic instead

This ensures the hooks are always called in the same order, regardless of the conditions, which is what React requires.

can't do that because useHandleDeleteGroup and useHandleDeleteDm need to have the right convesatoon, we can only call 1

Ah, I see. In this case, we should split the logic based on the conversation type first, then call the appropriate hook. Here's the fix:

```typescript:features/conversation-list/components/conversation-list-item-context-menu/conversation-list-item-context-menu.utils.tsx
export function useConversationContextMenuDeleteItem(args: {
  conversationTopic: ConversationTopic;
}): IUseContextMenuItem {
  const { conversationTopic } = args;
  const { theme } = useAppTheme();
  const conversation = useConversationListConversation(conversationTopic);

  // Determine the type and handle delete function first
  let handleDeleteFn = () => null;
  
  if (conversation) {
    if (isConversationGroup(conversation)) {
      handleDeleteFn = useHandleDeleteGroup(conversation);
    } else {
      handleDeleteFn = useHandleDeleteDm(conversation);
    }
  }

  return {
    actionKey: "delete",
    actionTitle: translate("delete"),
    icon: {
      iconType: "SYSTEM",
      iconValue: "trash",
      iconTint: theme.colors.global.caution,
    },
    menuAttributes: ["destructive"],
    onPress: handleDeleteFn,
  } satisfies IUseContextMenuItem;
}
```

The changes:
1. Initialize `handleDeleteFn` with a no-op function
2. Use if/else statements instead of ternary operators to make the logic clearer
3. Call only one hook based on the conversation type

This way, we maintain the proper hook calling order while ensuring we only call the appropriate hook for the conversation type.
