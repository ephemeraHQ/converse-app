whit step always take 2 minutes+ . Why ? anything we can do better? Maybe check online?

Looking at the EAS setup step, there are a few optimizations we can make based on the official Expo documentation and community practices. The main reason for the delay is that the action needs to download and install the EAS CLI each time.

Here's how we can improve it:

```yaml:.github/workflows/preview-deployment.yml
// ... existing code ...
      - name: Setup EAS
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          eas-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}
          packager: yarn
          cache: true
// ... existing code ...
```

Key improvements:
1. Added `packager: yarn` to specify the package manager (since you're using yarn)
2. Added `cache: true` to enable caching of the EAS CLI installation

These changes should help reduce the setup time. The `cache` option is particularly important as it will:
- Cache the EAS CLI installation between workflow runs
- Prevent downloading and installing EAS CLI from scratch each time
- Significantly reduce the setup time in subsequent runs

Note that the first run will still take the usual time, but subsequent runs should be much faster due to caching.

If you're still experiencing slow times after this change, you might want to consider:
1. Using a specific version instead of `latest` (e.g., `eas-version: "7.1.2"`)
2. Running the EAS setup in parallel with other steps when possible

Based on the official Expo GitHub Action documentation, we can optimize the EAS setup step in several ways. Here's the improved version:

```yaml:.github/workflows/preview-deployment.yml
// ... existing code ...
      - name: Setup EAS
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          eas-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}
          packager: yarn
          eas-cache: true
          patch-watchers: true
// ... existing code ...
```

Key improvements:
1. Added `packager: yarn` - explicitly specifies yarn as the package manager
2. Added `eas-cache: true` - enables caching of the EAS CLI installation (this is actually the proper option name, not just `cache`)
3. Added `patch-watchers: true` - ensures proper fs.inotify limits on Ubuntu to prevent ENOSPC errors

These optimizations should help reduce the setup time significantly because:
- The cache will store the EAS CLI installation between runs
- Using the correct package manager avoids any potential resolution delays
- The patched watchers prevent potential memory-related bottlenecks

According to [the official documentation](https://github.com/expo/expo-github-action), these settings represent the recommended configuration for optimal performance.

Additional tips to further improve performance:
1. Consider using a specific EAS version instead of `latest` if you don't need the newest features
2. Make sure your Node setup step (which comes before EAS) also has proper caching configured
3. The cache is counted towards your repo cache limit, but the performance benefit usually outweighs the storage cost

why "patch-watchers:ture"?

_**Assistant**_

Based on the documentation, `patch-watchers: true` is an important option specifically for Ubuntu runners (which you're using) to prevent `ENOSPC` errors during builds.

From [the documentation](https://github.com/expo/expo-github-action), this option exists because:

1. Creating new bundles with Metro (React Native's bundler) can be memory intensive
2. Some builds can result in `ENOSPC` (No space left on device) errors on Linux systems
3. This happens because of the default fs.inotify limits being too low on Ubuntu

When `patch-watchers: true` is set, the action automatically:
- Patches the file system watchers limits
- Sets more sensible defaults for file system availability on Ubuntu
- Prevents the `ENOSPC` errors that can occur during Metro bundling

Here's the relevant code update:

```yaml:.github/workflows/preview-deployment.yml
      - name: Setup EAS
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          eas-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}
          packager: yarn
          eas-cache: true
          patch-watchers: true  # Prevents ENOSPC errors on Ubuntu runners
```

This is particularly important for your workflow since you're using `ubuntu-latest` as your runner. Without this setting, you might encounter build failures on larger applications due to file system limitations.

ok anything else we can do to op^timze this git action? @https://github.com/actions/cache#cache-limits

_**Assistant**_

Based on the GitHub Actions cache documentation and looking at your workflow, here are several optimizations we can make:

```yaml:.github/workflows/preview-deployment.yml
      - name: Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: .nvmrc
          cache: "yarn"
          cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock
        env:
          SKIP_YARN_COREPACK_CHECK: "1"

      # Add explicit caching for node_modules
      - name: Cache node_modules
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |
            **/node_modules
            ~/.cache/yarn
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-modules-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-modules-

      # Add EAS build cache
      - name: Cache EAS Build
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.eas-cli/build-cache
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-eas-build-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}-${{ hashFiles('**/package.json') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-eas-build-

      - name: Setup EAS
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          eas-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}
          packager: yarn
          eas-cache: true
          patch-watchers: true
```

Key optimizations:

1. **Node Modules Caching**: Added explicit caching for `node_modules` and yarn cache directory. This can significantly speed up dependency installation.

2. **EAS Build Cache**: Added caching for EAS build artifacts in `~/.eas-cli/build-cache`. This can help speed up subsequent builds.

3. **Cache Keys Strategy**:
   - Primary keys use `hashFiles` of both `yarn.lock` and `package.json` to ensure cache invalidation when dependencies change
   - Added `restore-keys` for partial matches when exact cache isn't found

4. **Cache Paths**: Using multiple paths in a single cache action to reduce the number of cache operations.

Remember that according to [the documentation](https://github.com/actions/cache#cache-limits):
- There's a 10GB cache limit per repository
- Caches not accessed in over a week will be evicted
- When the 10GB limit is reached, older caches will be evicted based on last access time

You might also want to consider:
1. Adding cache for the Expo CLI cache directory
2. Setting up cache retention policies based on your needs
3. Using more specific cache keys if you need to maintain different caches for different build configurations

but i don't want to cache the builds no??

Ah, you're right! For preview deployments, we typically don't want to cache the builds themselves since:

1. Each preview build should be fresh
2. Preview builds are temporary by nature
3. Caching builds could potentially lead to stale previews
4. It would consume cache storage unnecessarily

Here's the optimized version focusing only on dependencies caching:

```yaml:.github/workflows/preview-deployment.yml
      - name: Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: .nvmrc
          cache: "yarn"
          cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock
        env:
          SKIP_YARN_COREPACK_CHECK: "1"

      # Cache node_modules and yarn cache
      - name: Cache Dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: |
            **/node_modules
            ~/.cache/yarn
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-deps-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-deps-

      - name: Setup EAS
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          eas-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}
          packager: yarn
          eas-cache: true
          patch-watchers: true
```

This version:
1. Removes the EAS build cache (which wasn't needed)
2. Keeps the dependency caching which will speed up the installation process
3. Still maintains the EAS CLI cache through `eas-cache: true` which helps with the CLI tool itself, not the builds

This should give you the best balance of speed and correctness for preview deployments.
