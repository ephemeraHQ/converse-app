This TODO comment appears to be related to iOS development best practices. In iOS development, "schemes" refer to Xcode schemes, which are a way to configure how your app builds, runs, and tests. They can define different environments, configurations, and settings for your app.

The comment suggests that currently, the workflow is manually handling environment-specific configurations for iOS builds through scripts (`scripts/build/ios/production.js` and `scripts/build/ios/preview.js`), but this isn't the ideal way to do it.

Using Xcode schemes would be a better approach because:

1. It's the native iOS way to handle different environments
2. It allows for better configuration management directly within Xcode
3. It's more maintainable and follows iOS development conventions
4. It can handle environment-specific settings, variables, and configurations more elegantly
5. It reduces the need for external scripts to modify iOS configurations

The TODO is essentially saying "we should refactor this to use proper iOS schemes instead of relying on external scripts to modify iOS configurations." This would be a more robust and standard way to handle different build environments in iOS development.

The current approach using scripts might have been implemented as a quick solution or temporary workaround, but the developer acknowledges that using proper iOS schemes would be a better long-term solution.
