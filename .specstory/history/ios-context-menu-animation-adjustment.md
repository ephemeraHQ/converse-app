## iOS Context Menu Animation Adjustment (2/3/2025, 1:43:52 PM)

i want the animation to feel like iOS context menu long presss like it slowly scale down and then up faster you know?

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you adjust the animation timing to make it feel more like the iOS context menu long press. The iOS animation typically has a slower scale down and then a quicker bounce back up. Here's how we can modify it:

```typescript:design-system/context-menu/context-menu.ios.tsx
// ... existing code ...
      scaleAV.value = withSequence(
        withSpring(0.95, {
          duration: 500,
          dampingRatio: 1, // More controlled movement
        }),
        withSpring(1.02, {
          duration: 200,
          dampingRatio: 0.7, // Slightly bouncy on the way up
        })
      );
// ... existing code ...
```

The changes made:
1. Adjusted the scale down to 0.95 (slightly more noticeable)
2. Increased the duration of scaling down to 500ms to make it feel more deliberate
3. Reduced the scale up to 1.02 (more subtle bounce)
4. Decreased the duration of scaling up to 200ms to make it snappier
5. Added `dampingRatio` parameters to control the spring physics:
   - 1.0 for the down movement (no bounce)
   - 0.7 for the up movement (slight bounce)

This should create a more iOS-like feel with a slower, controlled scale down followed by a quicker, slightly bouncy scale up.

don't need to use withSpring, you can use withTiming and custom Easing 

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes, using `withTiming` and custom `Easing` will give us more precise control over the animation. Here's the improved version:

```typescript:design-system/context-menu/context-menu.ios.tsx
// ... existing code ...
import { Easing } from "react-native-reanimated";

// ... existing code ...
      scaleAV.value = withSequence(
        withTiming(0.95, {
          duration: 500,
          easing: Easing.bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1), // Slow ease-out
        }),
        withTiming(1.02, {
          duration: 200,
          easing: Easing.bezier(0.33, 0, 0.67, 1), // Quick ease
        }),
        withTiming(1, {
          duration: 100,
          easing: Easing.bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1),
        })
      );
// ... existing code ...
```

The changes:
1. Added a third step to settle back to 1.0 scale
2. Using `withTiming` with custom bezier curves:
   - First curve (0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1) creates a smooth, slower ease-out for the scale down
   - Second curve (0.33, 0, 0.67, 1) provides a quicker, more energetic scale up
   - Third curve smoothly settles back to normal size
3. Timing adjusted to feel more natural:
   - 500ms for the initial scale down
   - 200ms for the quick scale up
   - 100ms for settling back to normal

This should create a smoother, more controlled iOS-like animation.
