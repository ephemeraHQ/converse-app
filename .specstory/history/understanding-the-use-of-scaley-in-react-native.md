## Understanding the Use of scaleY in React Native (11/7/2024, 8:40:12 AM)

why my teamate added this?

_**Assistant**_

This code snippet is specifically addressing a React Native styling issue. The `scaleY` property is being explicitly enabled in the `ViewReactNativeStyleAttributes` object.

This is typically added when you need to use the `scaleY` transform property in your React Native styles. The `scaleY` transform allows you to scale an element vertically. For example:

```typescript
const styles = {
  container: {
    transform: [{ scaleY: 0.5 }] // This scales the element to half its height
  }
}
```

Your teammate likely added this because:

1. They encountered an issue where `scaleY` transforms weren't working properly in the app
2. They needed to use vertical scaling animations with react-native-reanimated or regular Animated API
3. They found that the `scaleY` property wasn't registered by default in older versions of React Native

If you're not using `scaleY` transforms anywhere in your app, this code might be unnecessary. However, if you're using any animations or transformations that involve vertical scaling, this code ensures that the `scaleY` property is properly recognized by React Native's style system.

You might want to check with your teammate about:
1. Which specific feature or component required this addition
2. If it's still necessary with your current React Native version
3. If there are any animations in the app that depend on this property

but now scaleY is availbie in view no?

_**Assistant**_

Yes, you're correct! The `scaleY` transform property is now available by default in React Native's View component and has been for several versions.

This code appears to be legacy code that was likely added when:
1. Using an older version of React Native where `scaleY` wasn't included by default
2. Or it was added as a workaround for a specific bug at the time

You can safely remove these lines:

```typescript:polyfills.ts
// ... existing imports ...

// Remove these lines
import ViewReactNativeStyleAttributes from "react-native/Libraries/Components/View/ReactNativeStyleAttributes";
ViewReactNativeStyleAttributes.scaleY = true;

// ... rest of the file ...
```

Make sure to test any animations or transformations in your app after removing it, but in modern React Native versions, this polyfill is unnecessary.
