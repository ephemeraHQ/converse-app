Correct! When you specify `files` in an ESLint configuration object, it acts as an inclusive pattern - meaning ESLint will only apply these rules to files that match the pattern. Therefore, you don't need `ignores` in this specific config object since it will only target files matching `"utils/**/*.ts"`.

Here's how I would simplify that config block:

```javascript:eslint.config.mjs
  {
    name: "custom/utils-typescript",
    files: ["utils/**/*.ts"],
    languageOptions: {
      parser: parserTypescript,
      parserOptions: {
        ecmaVersion: "latest",
        sourceType: "module",
      },
    },
    plugins: {
      "custom-plugin": customPlugin,
    },
    rules: {
      "custom-plugin/single-function-per-file": "warn",
    },
  }
```

The `ignores` pattern is more useful in the main/global config (like in your first config object) where you want to explicitly exclude certain directories from all ESLint processing. In targeted configs like your utils-specific one, the `files` pattern is sufficient to scope the rules to just the files you want to check.
