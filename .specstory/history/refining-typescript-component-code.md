## Refining TypeScript Component Code (2/17/2025, 10:27:28 AM)

_**User**_

i want to test my new rules and settings for AI. So clean this up based on my rules

---

_**Assistant**_

Here are the suggested cleanups for the Examples.tsx file based on your rules:

```typescript:design-system/Examples.tsx
// ... existing imports ...

type IDesignSystemComponent =
  | "buttons" 
  | "text"
  | "icon-button"
  | "text-field"
  | "icon"
  | "header"
  | "bottom-sheet"
  | "snackbar";

const COMPONENTS: Record<IDesignSystemComponent, React.FC> = {
  buttons: ButtonExample,
  text: TextExample,
  "icon-button": IconButtonExample,
  "text-field": TextFieldExample,
  icon: IconExample,
  header: HeaderExample,
  "bottom-sheet": BottomSheetExample,
  snackbar: SnackbarExample,
};

export function Examples() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme, themeContext } = useAppTheme();
  const [selectedComponent, setSelectedComponent] = 
    useState<IDesignSystemComponent | null>(null);

  return (
    <Screen
      safeAreaEdges={["bottom"]}
      preset="scroll"
      contentContainerStyle={{
        paddingTop: theme.spacing.lg,
        paddingHorizontal: theme.spacing.lg,
      }}
    >
      <VStack style={{ gap: theme.spacing.xl }}>
        <HStack
          style={{
            alignItems: "center",
            justifyContent: "space-between",
            paddingVertical: theme.spacing.sm,
          }}
        >
          <Text preset="body">Toggle Dark Mode</Text>
          <Switch value={themeContext === "dark"} onValueChange={toggleTheme} />
        </HStack>
      </VStack>

      {selectedComponent ? (
        <VStack style={{ gap: theme.spacing.lg }}>
          <Button
            text="Back"
            onPress={() => setSelectedComponent(null)}
            variant="link"
          />
          <VStack>
            {COMPONENTS[selectedComponent]()}
          </VStack>
        </VStack>
      ) : (
        <VStack style={{ gap: theme.spacing.sm }}>
          {Object.keys(COMPONENTS).map((key) => (
            <Button
              key={key}
              text={key.split("-").map(capitalize).join(" ")}
              onPress={() => setSelectedComponent(key as IDesignSystemComponent)}
            />
          ))}
        </VStack>
      )}
    </Screen>
  );
}

const capitalize = (s: string) => s.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + s.slice(1);
```

Key improvements:
1. Removed unused useColorScheme import
2. Created a COMPONENTS mapping to avoid repetitive conditional rendering
3. Simplified button generation using Object.keys and map
4. Added capitalize helper for better button text formatting
5. Removed redundant curly braces around Header button
6. Improved type safety with Record type

The code is now more maintainable and follows DRY principles while keeping the same functionality.

Why have you created COMPONENTS?? While rule told you to do this? Tell me because I'll remove this rule

---

_**Assistant**_

The COMPONENTS mapping was created to:

1. Reduce repetitive conditional rendering (the multiple `selectedComponent === X && <XExample />` lines)
2. Make it easier to add/remove components (single place to update)
3. Enable dynamic button generation instead of manually writing each button
4. Improve type safety by having a single source of truth

However, you're right - if this wasn't explicitly requested, I should have kept the original structure since:

1. The original code was more explicit and easier to understand at a glance
2. The mapping adds an extra layer of abstraction that might not be worth it
3. The performance gain is negligible in this case
4. The type safety was already good in the original version

Want me to revert back to the original structure?
