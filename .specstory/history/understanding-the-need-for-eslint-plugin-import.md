## Understanding the Need for eslint-plugin-import (11/6/2024, 3:00:12 PM)

why would i need "eslint-plugin-import" ?

The `eslint-plugin-import` is a useful ESLint plugin that helps prevent various issues related to ES6+ import/export syntax. Here are the main benefits:

1. **Path Problems**
   - Ensures imports point to existing files
   - Catches typos in import paths
   - Validates that imported modules can be resolved

2. **Import Organization**
   - Can enforce a consistent order of imports
   - Can group imports by type (built-in, external, internal)
   - Prevents duplicate imports

3. **Best Practices**
   - Prevents importing from restricted paths
   - Can enforce using named exports vs default exports
   - Prevents cyclic dependencies

In your current config, you're using it for:
```javascript:eslint.config.mjs
// ... existing code ...
rules: {
  ...pluginImport.configs["recommended"].rules,
  "import/no-default-export": "warn",  // Warns when using default exports
  "import/order": "off",               // You've disabled import ordering
  // ... existing code ...
}
```

However, if you're not particularly concerned about import organization and you're using TypeScript (which already handles many path-related issues), you could potentially remove this plugin. The main value you're getting from it right now is the warning about default exports.

If you decide to keep it, you might want to consider enabling `import/order` to help maintain consistent import organization across your codebase.

but if I have typescript this is useless no?

Yes, you're correct! For TypeScript projects, `eslint-plugin-import` is largely redundant because:

1. TypeScript already handles:
   - Path resolution and validation
   - Module existence checking
   - Import/export validation
   - Circular dependency detection

2. The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) will catch most import-related issues that this plugin tries to catch.

Here's how you can simplify your config by removing the import plugin:

```javascript:eslint.config.mjs
// Remove this import
- import pluginImport from "eslint-plugin-import";

// In the plugins section
plugins: {
  "@typescript-eslint": pluginTypescript,
  react: pluginReact,
-  import: pluginImport,
  "react-hooks": pluginReactHooks,
  "react-native": fixupPluginRules(pluginReactNative),
  "custom-plugin": customPlugin,
},

// In the rules section
rules: {
  ...pluginTypescript.configs["recommended"].rules,
  ...pluginReact.configs["recommended"].rules,
-  ...pluginImport.configs["recommended"].rules,
  ...pluginReactHooks.configs["recommended"].rules,
  ...pluginReactNative.configs["all"].rules,

-  "import/no-default-export": "warn",
-  "import/order": "off",
  // ... rest of rules
}
```

If you still want to warn about default exports, you could use TypeScript's `@typescript-eslint` rules instead, though in this case you might need to create a custom rule if this specific functionality is important to you.
