should i put AuxiliaryView or auxiliaryView is good?

In TypeScript, especially when defining types or props, it's common to use camelCase for variable names, including property names in types or interfaces. Therefore, using `auxiliaryView` is consistent with this convention and is considered good practice.

Here's the relevant part of your code with the camelCase naming:

```typescript:components/Chat/Message/MessageContextMenu.tsx
export type IMessageContextMenuProps = {
  Content: React.ReactNode;
  itemRectY: number;
  itemRectX: number;
  itemRectHeight: number;
  itemRectWidth: number;
  items: TableViewItemType[];
  fromMe: boolean;
  onClose?: () => void;
  auxiliaryView?: React.ReactNode; // camelCase is preferred
};
```

Using `auxiliaryView` aligns with the standard naming conventions in JavaScript and TypeScript, making your code more readable and maintainable.

but even if the prop is a React node?

_**Assistant**_

Yes, even if the prop is a React node, the convention is to use camelCase for prop names. This is consistent with JavaScript and TypeScript naming conventions, which help maintain readability and consistency across your codebase.

Here's a brief explanation:

- **camelCase**: Used for variable names, function names, and property names in objects and types. This includes props in React components, regardless of their type (e.g., numbers, strings, functions, or React nodes).

- **PascalCase**: Typically used for naming React components and TypeScript types or interfaces.

So, even if `auxiliaryView` is a React node, using camelCase is appropriate:

```typescript:components/Chat/Message/MessageContextMenu.tsx
export type IMessageContextMenuProps = {
  Content: React.ReactNode;
  itemRectY: number;
  itemRectX: number;
  itemRectHeight: number;
  itemRectWidth: number;
  items: TableViewItemType[];
  fromMe: boolean;
  onClose?: () => void;
  auxiliaryView?: React.ReactNode; // camelCase for prop names
};
```

This approach ensures consistency and aligns with common JavaScript and TypeScript practices.

but a reactNode is a typescript component no?

---

_**Assistant**_

A `ReactNode` is not a TypeScript component; rather, it is a type that represents any node that can be rendered by React. This includes:

- Strings and numbers
- React elements (e.g., JSX)
- Arrays or fragments containing other `ReactNode` types
- `null` and `undefined` (representing nothing to render)

In TypeScript, `ReactNode` is defined as a union type that encompasses all these possibilities. It is used to type props that can accept any valid React content.

Here's a quick breakdown:

- **React Components**: These are typically defined as functions or classes and are named using PascalCase (e.g., `MyComponent`).

- **ReactNode**: This is a type that can represent any renderable content in React, not a component itself.

Given this, the naming convention for props that accept a `ReactNode` should still follow camelCase, as it is a property name within a type or interface. Here's how you might define a prop that accepts a `ReactNode`:

```typescript:components/Chat/Message/MessageContextMenu.tsx
export type IMessageContextMenuProps = {
  Content: React.ReactNode; // This is a prop that can accept any renderable React content
  itemRectY: number;
  itemRectX: number;
  itemRectHeight: number;
  itemRectWidth: number;
  items: TableViewItemType[];
  fromMe: boolean;
  onClose?: () => void;
  auxiliaryView?: React.ReactNode; // camelCase is used for prop names
};
```

In summary, while `ReactNode` is a type that can include components, it is not a component itself, and the naming convention for props remains camelCase.
