## Organizing Polyfills in JavaScript (2/6/2025, 8:35:30 PM)

_**User**_

i have those here but i also have some in @index.js  and i'm actually calling the polyfill file at the top in @App.tsx . Should i put them all in @index.js ??

Yes, it's generally better to consolidate all polyfills in one place, and `index.js` is the ideal location since it's the entry point of your application. This ensures that all polyfills are loaded before any other code runs.

Here's how you should reorganize your polyfills:

1. Move all polyfills to `polyfills.ts`:

```typescript:polyfills.ts
// WalletConnect
import "@walletconnect/react-native-compat";

// Privy requirements (order matters)
import "fast-text-encoding";
import "react-native-get-random-values";
import "@ethersproject/shims";

// Other polyfills
import "@azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill";
import "react-native-polyfill-globals/auto";
import { Crypto as WebCrypto } from "@peculiar/webcrypto";
import "@stardazed/streams-polyfill";
import "react-native-url-polyfill/auto";
import "react-native-gesture-handler";

// Buffer polyfill
if (!global.Buffer) {
  global.Buffer = require("safe-buffer").Buffer;
}

// SubtleCrypto polyfill
if (!global.crypto.subtle) {
  const webCrypto = new WebCrypto();
  (global.crypto as any).subtle = webCrypto.subtle;
}
```

2. Update `index.js` to import polyfills first:

```javascript:index.js
import "./wdyr";
import "./polyfills";

import { registerRootComponent } from "expo";
import App from "./App";

registerRootComponent(App);
```

3. Remove the polyfill import from `App.tsx`:

```typescript:App.tsx
// Remove this line
// import "./polyfills";

// Rest of your App.tsx remains the same
import { PrivyProvider } from "@privy-io/expo";
// ...
```

This reorganization provides several benefits:
- All polyfills are loaded before any application code
- Easier to maintain and manage polyfills in one place
- Clearer dependency loading order
- Reduces the chance of polyfill-related timing issues

but is "react-native-gesture-handler" really a polyfill?

---

_**Assistant**_

No, you're right - `react-native-gesture-handler` is not a polyfill. It's a native module for handling gestures in React Native applications. I apologize for including it in the polyfills suggestion.

Let's correct the `polyfills.ts` file to only include actual polyfills:

```typescript:polyfills.ts
// WalletConnect
import "@walletconnect/react-native-compat";

// Privy requirements (order matters)
import "fast-text-encoding";
import "react-native-get-random-values";
import "@ethersproject/shims";

// Other polyfills
import "@azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill";
import "react-native-polyfill-globals/auto";
import { Crypto as WebCrypto } from "@peculiar/webcrypto";
import "@stardazed/streams-polyfill";

// Buffer polyfill
if (!global.Buffer) {
  global.Buffer = require("safe-buffer").Buffer;
}

// SubtleCrypto polyfill
if (!global.crypto.subtle) {
  const webCrypto = new WebCrypto();
  (global.crypto as any).subtle = webCrypto.subtle;
}
```

Native modules and UI libraries like `react-native-gesture-handler` should be imported where they're needed in the application code, not in the polyfills file.

where is "import "react-native-url-polyfill/auto";" ?

---

_**Assistant**_



I apologize for the oversight. The `react-native-url-polyfill/auto` is indeed a polyfill and should be included in the `polyfills.ts` file. Here's the complete and correct version:

```typescript:polyfills.ts
// WalletConnect
import "@walletconnect/react-native-compat";

// Privy requirements (order matters)
import "fast-text-encoding";
import "react-native-get-random-values";
import "@ethersproject/shims";

// Other polyfills
import "@azure/core-asynciterator-polyfill";
import "react-native-polyfill-globals/auto";
import "react-native-url-polyfill/auto";
import { Crypto as WebCrypto } from "@peculiar/webcrypto";
import "@stardazed/streams-polyfill";

// Buffer polyfill
if (!global.Buffer) {
  global.Buffer = require("safe-buffer").Buffer;
}

// SubtleCrypto polyfill
if (!global.crypto.subtle) {
  const webCrypto = new WebCrypto();
  (global.crypto as any).subtle = webCrypto.subtle;
}
```

The URL polyfill is important for React Native as it provides the URL and URLSearchParams APIs that are available in web browsers but not natively in React Native.

_**User**_

are those really polyfills?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, they are polyfills, but they serve different purposes:

1. `fast-text-encoding`: This is a polyfill for the `TextEncoder` and `TextDecoder` APIs, which are available in modern browsers but not natively in React Native. These are used for encoding and decoding text between different character encodings.

2. `react-native-get-random-values`: This is a polyfill for the Web Crypto API's `getRandomValues` method. It provides cryptographically secure random values in React Native, similar to what you'd get in a web browser. It's essential for cryptographic operations.

3. `@ethersproject/shims`: While not strictly a polyfill in the traditional sense, it provides necessary compatibility shims for the ethers.js library to work in React Native. It adds or modifies certain JavaScript environment features to make ethers.js work correctly in the React Native runtime.

These are all listed in Privy's documentation as required dependencies that need to be imported in this specific order for their SDK to work properly in React Native. While they might not all be traditional polyfills (especially the ethers shims), they all serve to provide functionality that's missing from or needs to be modified in the React Native environment.
