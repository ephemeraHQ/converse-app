## TypeScript Type Error Resolution (11/27/2024, 9:34:23 AM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type '{ referencedMessageId?: string | undefined; remoteAttachment: RemoteAttachmentContent; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'IComposerSendArgs'.
  Types of property 'referencedMessageId' are incompatible.
    Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'MessageId | undefined'.
      Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'MessageId'.
        Type 'string' is not assignable to type '{ readonly brand: unique symbol; }'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error you're encountering is due to a type mismatch between `string` and `MessageId`. The `referencedMessageId` is expected to be of type `MessageId`, but it's currently a `string`. To resolve this, you need to ensure that `replyingToMessageId` is correctly typed as `MessageId`.

Here's a concise fix:

```typescript:features/conversation/composer/composer.tsx
        remoteAttachment: uploadedRemoteAttachment,
        ...(replyingToMessageId && {
          referencedMessageId: replyingToMessageId as MessageId, // Cast to MessageId
        }),
```

### Explanation

- **Type Casting**: By using `as MessageId`, you're explicitly telling TypeScript to treat `replyingToMessageId` as a `MessageId`. This should resolve the type mismatch error.

Ensure that `replyingToMessageId` is indeed a valid `MessageId` in your application logic to avoid runtime errors.
