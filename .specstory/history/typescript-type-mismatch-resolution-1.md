## TypeScript Type Mismatch Resolution (11/27/2024, 9:34:37 AM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type '{ referencedMessageId?: string | undefined; remoteAttachment: RemoteAttachmentContent; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'IComposerSendArgs'.
  Types of property 'referencedMessageId' are incompatible.
    Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'MessageId | undefined'.
      Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'MessageId'.
        Type 'string' is not assignable to type '{ readonly brand: unique symbol; }'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error you're encountering is due to a type mismatch between `string` and `MessageId`. The `MessageId` type is likely a branded type, which means it's a `string` with an additional type constraint. To resolve this, you need to ensure that `replyingToMessageId` is of type `MessageId`.

Here's a concise fix:

```typescript:features/conversation/composer/composer.tsx
        remoteAttachment: uploadedRemoteAttachment,
        ...(replyingToMessageId && {
          referencedMessageId: replyingToMessageId as MessageId,
        }),
```

### Explanation

- **Type Assertion**: The `as MessageId` assertion is used to tell TypeScript that `replyingToMessageId` should be treated as a `MessageId`. This is a common approach when you are certain about the type but TypeScript is not able to infer it directly.

Make sure that `replyingToMessageId` is indeed a valid `MessageId` at runtime to avoid potential issues. If `replyingToMessageId` is not guaranteed to be a `MessageId`, you might need to convert or validate it before this assignment.
