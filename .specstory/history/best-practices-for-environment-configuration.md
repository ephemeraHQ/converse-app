## Best Practices for Environment Configuration (1/20/2025, 5:40:35 PM)

is it good ot have env as a property ? Or should it be outside of config

_**Assistant**_

It's generally better to keep environment configuration (`env`) separate from the main application config. Here's why:

1. Environment is typically a top-level concern that determines which config to load
2. It's more flexible for deployment and testing
3. It follows the principle of separation of concerns
4. It makes it easier to handle environment-specific logic

Here's how I would modify the config:

```typescript:config/config.types.ts
import { IXmtpEnv } from "@/utils/xmtpRN/xmtp.types";

// ... existing code ...

export type IConfig = {
  debugMenu: boolean;
  debugAddresses: string[];
  lensApiDomain: string;
  lensSuffix: string;
  sentryDSN: string;
  framesAllowedSchemes: ("http" | "https" | "ethereum")[];
  walletConnectConfig: IWalletConnectConfig;
  thirdwebClientId: string;
  xmtpEnv: IXmtpEnv;
  apiURI: string;
  bundleId: string;
  appleAppGroup: string;
  scheme: string;
  websiteDomain: string;
  usernameSuffix: string;
  universalLinks: string[];
  privy: IPrivyConfig;
  evm: IEvmConfig;
  appCheckDebugToken?: string;
};

// Define environment type separately
export type IEnvironment = "dev" | "prod";
```

Then you would typically handle the environment in a separate file or at the configuration loading level, like:

```typescript:config/index.ts
const environment: IEnvironment = process.env.NODE_ENV === "production" ? "prod" : "dev";

// Load config based on environment
const config: IConfig = loadConfig(environment);
```

This approach:
- Makes it clearer that environment is a higher-level concern
- Allows for easier environment-based configuration loading
- Keeps the config type focused on actual configuration values
- Makes it easier to handle environment-specific logic without mixing it with application configuration
