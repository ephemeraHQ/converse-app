_**Assistant**_

To improve the function name, we should aim for a name that clearly describes the purpose and action of the function. Since this function handles the processing of a decrypted remote attachment, a more descriptive name could be `processDecryptedRemoteAttachment`.

Here's how you can update the function name:

```typescript:utils/attachment/handleDecryptedRemoteAttachment.ts
export const processDecryptedRemoteAttachment = async (args: {
  messageId: string;
  localAttachment: DecryptedLocalAttachment;
}) => {
  const { messageId, localAttachment } = args;

  // ... existing code ...
};
```

### Explanation
- **`processDecryptedRemoteAttachment`**: This name indicates that the function is responsible for processing a decrypted remote attachment, which aligns with the function's operations of moving and handling the attachment file.
