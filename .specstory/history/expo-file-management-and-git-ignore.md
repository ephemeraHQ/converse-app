## Expo File Management and Git Ignore (2/6/2025, 7:50:47 PM)

does it make sense to have those if im using expo?

_**Assistant**_

Since you're using Expo, some of those entries might not be necessary depending on your development workflow. Here's what each of those files is for:

- `*.jks`, `*.p8`, `*.p12`, `*.key` - These are various types of cryptographic key/certificate files used for app signing
- `*.mobileprovision` - iOS provisioning profiles
- `*.orig.*` - Backup files created during merge conflicts

If you're using Expo in "managed workflow" (not ejected):
- You don't need to worry about most of these files since Expo handles signing and provisioning for you through EAS Build
- You can safely remove these entries

If you're using Expo in "bare workflow" (ejected) or plan to eject:
- Keep these entries as you might need to handle app signing manually
- These files contain sensitive information that shouldn't be in version control

Here's how you could update that section:

```gitignore:
// ... existing code ...

# Only needed for bare workflow
# *.jks
# *.p8
# *.p12
# *.key
# *.mobileprovision

*.orig.*

// ... existing code ...
```

I've commented out the signing-related entries but kept `*.orig.*` since that's generally useful for any Git repository regardless of your workflow. You can uncomment them if you switch to bare workflow later.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Property 'getKeys' is missing in type '{ get: (key: string) => Promise<unknown>; put: (key: string, value: string) => Promise<void>; del: (key: string) => Promise<void>; }' but required in type 'Storage'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

You need to add the `getKeys` method to the storage object. Here's the fix:

```typescript:App.tsx
// ... existing code ...
        storage={{
          get: async (key: string) => {
            return await privySecureStorage.get(key);
          },
          put: async (key: string, value: string) => {
            await privySecureStorage.put(key, value);
          },
          del: async (key: string) => {
            await privySecureStorage.del(key);
          },
          getKeys: async () => {
            return await privySecureStorage.getKeys();
          }
        }}
// ... existing code ...
```

This assumes `privySecureStorage` has a `getKeys` method. If it doesn't, you'll need to implement it in your `privySecureStorage` utility.
