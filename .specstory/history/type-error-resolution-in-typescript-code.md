## Type Error Resolution in TypeScript Code (11/26/2024, 12:57:16 PM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'text' does not exist in type '() => string | object | CoinbaseMessagingPaymentContent | TransactionReference | StaticAttachmentContent | RemoteAttachmentContent | ReplyContent | GroupUpdatedContent | ReactionContent'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error you're encountering suggests that the `text` property is not a valid property for the type expected by the `content` object. To resolve this, you need to ensure that the `content` object is structured according to the expected type. If `text` is not a valid property, you may need to wrap it in a valid structure or use a different property.

Here's a concise fix:

```typescript:features/conversation/dm-conversation.screen.tsx
          content: { 
            text: "RANDOM_MESSAGE_TEXT" 
          } as any, // Temporarily using 'any' to bypass type error
        });
      },
```

### Explanation:
- **Temporary Fix**: The `as any` cast is a temporary measure to bypass the type error. This is not ideal for long-term solutions but can be used to quickly resolve the issue while you investigate the correct type structure.
- **Long-term Solution**: You should check the type definition for `content` and ensure that the `text` property is correctly defined or use a valid property that matches the expected type. If `text` should be a valid property, you might need to update the type definition accordingly.
