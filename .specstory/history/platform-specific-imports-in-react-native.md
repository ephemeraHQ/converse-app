Yes, if you import the `Button` component like this:

```typescript
import { Button } from "../design-system/Button/Button";
```

React Native will automatically use the platform-specific implementation for Android if you have a `Button.android.tsx` file in the same directory. This is due to React Native's platform-specific file extension feature.

Here's how it works:

1. When you import from `"../design-system/Button/Button"`, React Native looks for files with the following extensions in order:

   - `.android.ts`
   - `.android.tsx`
   - `.ts`
   - `.tsx`

2. If you have a `Button.android.tsx` file in the `design-system/Button/` directory, React Native will use that file when running on Android devices.

3. For iOS and other platforms, it will fall back to `Button.tsx` (or `Button.ts` if it exists).

This allows you to create platform-specific implementations of your components without changing the import statements in your code. It's a powerful feature for customizing your app's behavior and appearance for different platforms.

Remember to keep the exports consistent between your platform-specific files to ensure that the rest of your application can use the component in the same way regardless of the platform.
