## SpecStory

## Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the changes made to the `ConnectViaWallet` component to utilize the context store instead of passing props:

1. **Refactor Hooks**: The `useXmtpConnection` and `useUIContent` hooks were modified to directly access the necessary state and functions from the `ConnectViaWalletStoreContext` instead of receiving them as props.

2. **Simplify Component Logic**: The `Content` component now retrieves all required state and functions from the context, streamlining the component's logic and reducing the need for prop drilling.

3. **Maintain Functionality**: The core functionality of the component remains intact, ensuring that the onboarding process and wallet connection logic continue to work as intended.

This approach enhances code readability, maintainability, and reusability by centralizing state management through context, allowing for easier updates and modifications in the future. (10/8/2024, 12:30:37 PM)

in lots of reusauble hooks or components, instead of passing signer, address, etc... as props, go take them from the context store! using useConnectViaWalletStoreContext

_**Assistant**_

Certainly! I'll refactor the code to use the `useConnectViaWalletStoreContext` hook instead of passing props for reusable components and hooks. Here's the updated version:

```typescript:components/Onboarding/ConnectViaWallet.tsx
// ... (previous imports and code remain the same)

function useXmtpConnection() {
  const {
    signer,
    address,
    onXmtp,
    alreadyV3Db,
    setLoading,
    setWaitingForNextSignature,
    setSignaturesDone,
    setOnXmtp,
    setAlreadyV3Db,
  } = useConnectViaWalletStoreContext((state) => ({
    signer: state.signer,
    address: state.address,
    onXmtp: state.onXmtp,
    alreadyV3Db: state.alreadyV3Db,
    setLoading: state.setLoading,
    setWaitingForNextSignature: state.setWaitingForNextSignature,
    setSignaturesDone: state.setSignaturesDone,
    setOnXmtp: state.setOnXmtp,
    setAlreadyV3Db: state.setAlreadyV3Db,
  }));

  const inXmtpClientCreationFlow = useRef(false);
  const initiatingClientFor = useRef<string | undefined>(undefined);
  const clickedSignature = useRef(false);

  const waitForClickSignature = useCallback(async () => {
    while (!clickedSignature.current) {
      await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 100));
    }
  }, []);

  const initXmtpClient = useCallback(async () => {
    // ... (rest of the initXmtpClient function remains the same)
  }, [
    address,
    alreadyV3Db,
    onXmtp,
    setLoading,
    signer,
    waitForClickSignature,
  ]);

  return { initXmtpClient };
}

function useUIContent() {
  const {
    signer,
    address,
    onXmtp,
    alreadyV3Db,
    waitingForNextSignature,
    loading,
    signaturesDone,
  } = useConnectViaWalletStoreContext((state) => ({
    signer: state.signer,
    address: state.address,
    onXmtp: state.onXmtp,
    alreadyV3Db: state.alreadyV3Db,
    waitingForNextSignature: state.waitingForNextSignature,
    loading: state.loading,
    signaturesDone: state.signaturesDone,
  }));

  // ... (rest of the useUIContent function remains the same)
}

const Content = memo(function Content() {
  const {
    signer,
    address,
    loading,
    signaturesDone,
    waitingForNextSignature,
    onXmtp,
    alreadyV3Db,
    setSigner,
    setAddress,
    setLoading,
    setSignaturesDone,
    setWaitingForNextSignature,
    setOnXmtp,
    setAlreadyV3Db,
    resetOnboarding,
  } = useConnectViaWalletStoreContext((state) => state);

  const { thirdwebSigner } = useThirdwebSigner();
  const { disconnect: disconnectWallet } = useThirdwebDisconnect();
  const thirdwebWallet = useActiveWallet();

  const disconnect = useCallback(
    async (resetLoading = true) => {
      // ... (rest of the disconnect function remains the same)
    },
    [address, resetOnboarding, setLoading, disconnectWallet, thirdwebWallet]
  );

  const { initXmtpClient } = useXmtpConnection();

  // ... (rest of the Content component remains the same)

  const { title, subtitle, backButton } = useUIContent();

  // ... (rest of the return statement remains the same)
});

// ... (rest of the file remains the same)
```

In this refactored version:

1. The `useXmtpConnection` hook now uses `useConnectViaWalletStoreContext` to access the required state and functions, eliminating the need for props.

2. The `useUIContent` hook also uses `useConnectViaWalletStoreContext` to access the necessary state, removing the need for props.

3. The `Content` component still uses `useConnectViaWalletStoreContext` to access all the state and functions it needs.

These changes make the code more modular and reduce prop drilling. The hooks and components now directly access the state they need from the context, making them more self-contained and easier to maintain.
