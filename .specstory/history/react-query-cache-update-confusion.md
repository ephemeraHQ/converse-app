## React Query Cache Update Confusion (1/16/2025, 11:39:55 AM)

_**User**_

So weird, I have useConversationQuery and an observer. when in update the conversation in react query cache it logs "lastMessageText ici:" but NOT "lastMessageText dans le composant" but why?? It's using the same query options?!

---

_**Assistant**_

I understand your confusion. The issue is related to how React Query's `QueryObserver` and the component's render cycle work differently. Let me explain the key differences and suggest a fix:

```typescript:features/conversation-list/conversation-list-item/conversation-list-item-dm.tsx
// ... existing code ...

export const ConversationListItemDm = memo(function ConversationListItemDm({
  conversationTopic,
}: IConversationListItemDmProps) {
  const currentAccount = useCurrentAccount()!;

  // This hook triggers re-renders when the data changes
  const { data: conversation } = useConversationQuery({
    account: currentAccount!,
    topic: conversationTopic,
  });

  // The observer works outside of React's render cycle
  useEffect(() => {
    const observer = new QueryObserver(
      queryClient,
      getConversationQueryOptions({
        account: currentAccount!,
        topic: conversationTopic,
      })
    );

    const unsubscribe = observer.subscribe((result) => {
      const lastMessage = result.data?.lastMessage;
      const lastMessageText = lastMessage?.content();
      console.log("lastMessageText ici:", lastMessageText);
    });

    return () => {
      unsubscribe();
    };
  }, [conversationTopic, currentAccount]);

  const lastMessageText = useMessagePlainText(conversation?.lastMessage);
  console.log("lastMessageText dans le composant:", lastMessageText);
  
  // ... rest of the code ...
```

The key differences are:

1. The `QueryObserver` subscription runs outside of React's render cycle and will fire immediately when the cache updates.

2. The component's `useConversationQuery` hook needs to trigger a re-render to show updated values, which might be batched or delayed by React's rendering cycle.

To fix this, you could:

1. Remove the separate observer since it's redundant with `useConversationQuery`, or
2. Use `useQueryClient().setQueryData()` to force an immediate update if you need it

The recommended approach would be to remove the observer entirely since `useConversationQuery` already handles cache updates and re-renders appropriately. If you need to respond to updates immediately, consider using the `onSuccess` callback in your query configuration instead.

But the "useConversationQuery" doens'T even rerender!!

_**Assistant**_

Ah, now I understand better! This is likely happening because the query cache update isn't triggering a re-render. Let's debug this by adding some logging and ensuring the query is properly configured to detect updates.

```typescript:features/conversation-list/conversation-list-item/conversation-list-item-dm.tsx
export const ConversationListItemDm = memo(function ConversationListItemDm({
  conversationTopic,
}: IConversationListItemDmProps) {
  const currentAccount = useCurrentAccount()!;

  // Add notifyOnChangeProps to ensure we're tracking data changes
  const { data: conversation } = useConversationQuery({
    account: currentAccount!,
    topic: conversationTopic,
  }, {
    notifyOnChangeProps: ['data'],
    // Add this to see when the query updates
    onSuccess: (data) => {
      console.log('Query updated:', data?.lastMessage?.content());
    },
  });

  // Let's also log render cycles
  console.log('Component rendered with conversation:', conversation?.lastMessage?.content());

  // ... rest of the code ...
```

Could you also share:
1. How are you updating the conversation in the React Query cache?
2. The implementation of `useConversationQuery`?

This might be happening because:
1. The cache update might not be triggering properly
2. The query might not be configured to detect the specific changes
3. `memo` might be preventing re-renders if the props comparison isn't handling the data change correctly

Let me know what you see with the added logging, and share the additional context if possible, so we can identify exactly where the update chain is breaking.

but by default if I update the data (conversation) elsewhere iT SHOULD rerender by default no?

---

_**Assistant**_

Yes, absolutely! By default, React Query will trigger a re-render when the cache data changes - you shouldn't need any special configuration for this to work.

This suggests there might be an issue with how the cache is being updated. Could you share:

1. How are you updating the conversation data in the cache?
2. Are you using `queryClient.setQueryData()` or some other method?

The fact that the `QueryObserver` sees the change but the component doesn't re-render suggests that either:
1. The cache update isn't happening correctly (maybe the query key doesn't match)
2. The data structure is being mutated instead of being replaced (React Query needs a new reference to detect changes)

Could you show me the code where you're updating the conversation data? That would help identify where the issue might be.

But wtf why still my query observer trigger the subscribe update and NOT the useQuery

This is actually a really interesting quirk of React Query! The `QueryObserver` and `useQuery` (which `useConversationQuery` presumably uses) handle updates differently:

- `QueryObserver` is a low-level primitive that directly subscribes to cache changes and fires immediately
- `useQuery` is bound to React's rendering cycle and includes additional optimizations to prevent unnecessary re-renders

The fact that the `QueryObserver` triggers but `useQuery` doesn't suggests one of these likely scenarios:

1. The data reference hasn't actually changed (most common cause)
```typescript
// This won't trigger a re-render because the reference is the same
queryClient.setQueryData(key, (old) => {
  old.someProperty = newValue; // mutation!
  return old;
});

// This WILL trigger a re-render because it creates a new reference
queryClient.setQueryData(key, (old) => {
  return { ...old, someProperty: newValue };
});
```

2. The query key might be slightly different between the observer and the hook

Could you share how you're updating the cache? That would help confirm if it's a data mutation issue vs a new reference issue.
