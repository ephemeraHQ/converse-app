In this background fetch task, we return specific `BackgroundFetchResult` values to communicate the outcome of the background task to the operating system. This is important for both iOS and Android to properly handle background tasks. Here's what each return value means:

1. `BackgroundFetchResult.NewData` (when `hadTasks` is true):
   - Indicates that the background task successfully executed and processed new data
   - Tells the OS that the task was meaningful and useful
   - May influence how often the OS allows future background fetches

2. `BackgroundFetchResult.NoData` (when `hadTasks` is false):
   - Indicates that the background task ran successfully but found no new data to process
   - Helps the OS optimize future background fetch scheduling
   - May result in less frequent background fetches if consistently returning NoData

3. `BackgroundFetchResult.Failed` (in catch block):
   - Indicates that the background task encountered an error
   - Helps the OS track task reliability
   - May influence retry behavior and scheduling

These return values help the mobile operating system optimize battery life and performance by adjusting how frequently it schedules background tasks based on their outcomes. For example, if your task frequently returns `NoData`, the OS might reduce the frequency of background fetches to save battery life.
