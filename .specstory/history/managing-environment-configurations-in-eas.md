_**Assistant**_

The provided JavaScript code is a script designed to manage environment configurations for building projects using Expo Application Services (EAS). Here's a breakdown of what it does:

1. **Imports Required Modules**:
   - `dotenv`: Used to parse environment variables from a `.env` file.
   - `fs`: Used for file system operations like reading and writing files.

2. **`handleEnv` Function**:
   - Takes an `environment` argument, which should be either `"production"` or `"preview"`.
   - Determines the path to the environment file (`.env.production` for production, `.env` for preview).
   - Checks if the specified environment file exists. If not, it throws an error.
   - Parses the environment variables from the file using `dotenv`.
   - Reads the `eas.json` file, which contains build configurations.
   - Iterates over each build configuration in `eas.json` and checks if the `channel` matches the specified environment.
   - If it matches, it merges the parsed environment variables into the build configuration's `env` property.
   - Writes the updated `eas.json` back to the file system.

3. **Module Export**:
   - Exports the `handleEnv` function for use in other modules.

4. **Command-Line Interface**:
   - If the script is run directly from the command line, it expects an argument `--env` followed by the environment name.
   - If the argument is not `--env`, it throws an error.
   - Calls `handleEnv` with the specified environment.

In summary, this script is used to update the `eas.json` file with environment-specific configurations by merging environment variables from a `.env` file into the build configurations. This is useful for setting up different environments (like production or preview) for building and deploying applications with EAS.
