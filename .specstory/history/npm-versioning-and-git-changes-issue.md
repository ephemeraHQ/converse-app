## NPM Versioning and Git Changes Issue (1/27/2025, 1:21:07 PM)

i run npm version minor and it changes pacja.gejosn version but then pacjagel.json doens't appear in my git changed files?

This is likely happening because the `npm version` command not only updates the version in package.json but also creates a git tag automatically. However, if you're using Yarn as your package manager (which I can see from your package.json), you should use `yarn version` instead of `npm version`.

Here are a few things to check:

1. First, make sure you're using the correct package manager command. Since your project uses Yarn (specifically Yarn 4.6.0), use:
```bash
yarn version minor
```

2. If you still don't see the changes in git, check if the file is gitignored by looking in your `.gitignore` file.

3. You can also try forcing git to recognize the change:
```bash
git add package.json -f
```

4. Or check the git status explicitly:
```bash
git status
```

If you want to disable the automatic git tagging behavior when versioning, you can add the `--no-git-tag-version` flag:
```bash
yarn version minor --no-git-tag-version
```

This will only update the version in package.json without creating a git tag or commit.

Ah, you're using Yarn 4.x which has different syntax for version commands. For Yarn 4, use this command instead:

```bash
yarn version update --minor --deferred
```

The `--deferred` flag will update the version number without creating a git tag or commit.

If you want to commit the change afterward, you can then use normal git commands:

```bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "chore: bump version to x.x.x"
```

This is one of the differences between Yarn 1.x and Yarn 4.x - the CLI commands have been updated and modernized in newer versions.

$ yarn version [-d,--deferred] [-i,--immediate] <strategy>

Ah, I apologize for the confusion. In Yarn 4, the version command syntax is slightly different. Here's the correct command:

```bash
yarn version patch --deferred
```

For different version increments, you can use:
- `yarn version patch --deferred` (for 0.0.x)
- `yarn version minor --deferred` (for 0.x.0)
- `yarn version major --deferred` (for x.0.0)

The `--deferred` flag will update the version without creating a git tag or commit, allowing you to commit the change manually afterward with:

```bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "chore: bump version"
```

what does deffered do?

_**Assistant**_



The `--deferred` flag in Yarn's version command means that the version change will only be applied to the package.json file, without immediately:
1. Creating a git commit
2. Creating a git tag
3. Publishing to npm

This gives you more control over the versioning process by letting you:
- Review the changes before committing
- Bundle the version bump with other changes in a single commit
- Manually create git tags if/when desired
- Publish to npm separately when ready

Without `--deferred`, Yarn would automatically create a commit and tag for the version change. The alternative flag is `--immediate`, which would perform all these actions automatically.

This is particularly useful in modern development workflows where you might want to:
- Include the version bump in a pull request
- Run CI checks before finalizing the version
- Control exactly when and how the changes are committed and published

why it creates something in .yarn/versions?

---

_**Assistant**_



The `.yarn/versions` directory is part of Yarn 4's "deferred versioning" system. When you use `--deferred`, instead of immediately updating the package.json version, Yarn creates a version entry file in `.yarn/versions/` that tracks the pending version changes.

This serves several purposes:
1. **Change Tracking**: It allows you to track version bumps across multiple packages in a monorepo
2. **Version Control**: These files can be committed to git, making version changes visible in pull requests
3. **Delayed Application**: The actual version changes won't be applied until you run `yarn version apply`

The workflow typically looks like this:

1. Create the deferred version:
```bash
yarn version minor --deferred
```

2. This creates a file in `.yarn/versions/` with a random name (like `xx.xx.xx.yml`)

3. When you're ready to apply all deferred versions:
```bash
yarn version apply
```

This will:
- Update the actual version in package.json
- Remove the entries from `.yarn/versions/`

This system is particularly useful in monorepos or when you want to coordinate version bumps across multiple changes or pull requests before actually applying them.

what if I ONLY want to bump package json version but don't want that .versions folder and git tag and etc...

---

_**Assistant**_



For a simple package.json version bump without any extra files or git operations, you can directly modify the package.json using `npm version` with the `--no-git-tag-version` flag:

```bash
npm version minor --no-git-tag-version
```

This will:
✅ Only update the version in package.json
❌ Won't create git tags
❌ Won't create .yarn/versions files
❌ Won't create commits

Then you can manually commit the change if desired:
```bash
git add package.json
git commit -m "chore: bump version"
```

This approach works even in a Yarn project since it's just directly modifying the package.json file without involving any package manager-specific versioning systems.
