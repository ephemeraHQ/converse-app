Will this work if i have 2 parents with border raidus?

_**Assistant**_

When dealing with nested elements that have multiple parent components, each with their own border radius, you need to consider the border radius of each parent individually. The key is to ensure that the nested element's border radius matches the curvature of its immediate parent.

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Identify the Immediate Parent**: Determine which parent component is directly enclosing the nested element. This is the parent whose border radius you need to match.

2. **Calculate the Nested Element's Border Radius**:
   - Use the border radius of the immediate parent.
   - Subtract half of the horizontal padding used in the nested element.

3. **Repeat for Each Level**: If the nested element itself contains further nested elements, repeat the process for each level of nesting.

This approach ensures that each nested element flows smoothly with its immediate parent's rounded corners, regardless of how many parent components there are.

Here's a simple example to illustrate:

```typescript
// Parent component with border radius
const parentStyle = {
  borderRadius: 24,
  padding: 16,
};

// Nested element
const nestedStyle = {
  borderRadius: parentStyle.borderRadius - parentStyle.padding / 2,
};

// Further nested element
const furtherNestedStyle = {
  borderRadius: nestedStyle.borderRadius - nestedPadding / 2,
};
```

In this example, `nestedStyle` calculates its border radius based on `parentStyle`, and `furtherNestedStyle` would calculate its border radius based on `nestedStyle`. This ensures a smooth visual transition between nested elements and their parents.

what is nestedPadding

_**Assistant**_

In the context of the example I provided, `nestedPadding` refers to the horizontal padding applied to the further nested element within the `nestedStyle` component. It represents the padding that you would apply to the element that is nested inside another element, which itself is already nested inside a parent.

Here's a more detailed breakdown:

- **`parentStyle`**: This is the style for the top-level parent component, which has a `borderRadius` and `padding`.

- **`nestedStyle`**: This is the style for the first-level nested component. Its `borderRadius` is calculated by subtracting half of the `parentStyle`'s padding from the `parentStyle`'s `borderRadius`.

- **`furtherNestedStyle`**: This is the style for a component nested inside the `nestedStyle` component. The `borderRadius` for this component is calculated by subtracting half of its own padding (`nestedPadding`) from the `nestedStyle`'s `borderRadius`.

Here's how you might define these styles in a React Native component:

```typescript
const parentStyle = {
  borderRadius: 24,
  padding: 16,
};

const nestedPadding = 8; // Example padding for the nested element

const nestedStyle = {
  borderRadius: parentStyle.borderRadius - parentStyle.padding / 2,
  padding: nestedPadding,
};

const furtherNestedStyle = {
  borderRadius: nestedStyle.borderRadius - nestedPadding / 2,
  // Additional styles for the further nested element
};
```

In this setup, `nestedPadding` is the padding applied to the `nestedStyle` component, and it is used to calculate the `borderRadius` for `furtherNestedStyle` to ensure it aligns smoothly with its immediate parent (`nestedStyle`).
