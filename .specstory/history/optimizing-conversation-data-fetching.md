## Optimizing Conversation Data Fetching (1/22/2025, 3:12:27 PM)

_**User**_

do you think i should fetch the conversation inside the "getPeerInboxId" function instead? Or having it as a hook like this is better

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me analyze both approaches:

**Current Approach (using useConversationQuery hook)**
Pros:
- Follows React Query's pattern of separating data fetching concerns
- Allows React Query to handle caching of the conversation data independently
- Other components can reuse the conversation data without refetching

Cons:
- Creates a dependency between two queries
- May cause unnecessary re-renders due to the additional hook

**Alternative Approach (fetching inside queryFn)**
Pros:
- Simpler dependency chain
- More direct control over the data flow
- Potentially fewer re-renders

Cons:
- Would fetch the conversation data every time the peer inbox ID is needed
- Wouldn't benefit from React Query's caching for the conversation data
- Would duplicate conversation fetching logic if needed elsewhere

**Recommendation:**
I recommend keeping the current approach because:
1. The conversation data is likely needed in other places in your app
2. React Query's caching will prevent unnecessary refetching
3. It follows the principle of separation of concerns
4. It's more maintainable and reusable

However, I would suggest a small improvement to make the dependency more explicit:

```typescript:queries/useDmPeerInbox.ts
// ... existing code ...
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: dmPeerInboxIdQueryKey(account, topic),
    queryFn: function getPeerInboxId() {
      if (!conversation) {
        throw new Error("Conversation not found");
      }
      if (!isConversationDm(conversation)) {
        throw new Error("Conversation is not a DM");
      }
      return conversation.peerInboxId();
    },
    // Make the dependency on conversation explicit in the enabled option
    enabled: Boolean(account && topic && conversation),
  });
// ... existing code ...
```

This approach aligns well with React Query's patterns and your codebase's principles of keeping features self-contained and reusable.
