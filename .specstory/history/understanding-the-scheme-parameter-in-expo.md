## Understanding the --scheme Parameter in Expo (1/17/2025, 12:50:43 PM)

why do we need --scheme here?

_**Assistant**_

The `--scheme` parameter in the Expo start command is used to specify a custom URL scheme for deep linking in your React Native application. 

Deep linking allows users to open your app directly from URLs, and the scheme defines what URLs your app will respond to. For example, with the scheme `converse-dev`, your app could handle URLs like:

```
converse-dev://some/path
```

This is particularly useful for:
1. Development workflows where you need to test deep linking functionality
2. Authentication flows (like OAuth) where services need to redirect back to your app
3. Opening the app from external links or other apps
4. Testing different environments (dev/staging/prod) with different URL schemes

In this case, `converse-dev` is likely used as the development environment scheme, while the production build probably uses a different scheme (like just `converse`). This separation ensures that deep links in development don't interfere with the production app if both are installed on the same device.

The scheme needs to match what's defined in your app configuration (typically in app.json or app.config.js) and your native platform configurations (Info.plist for iOS and AndroidManifest.xml for Android).
