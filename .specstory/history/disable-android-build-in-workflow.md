I'll help you modify the workflow file to disable the Android build. Here's the necessary changes:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
// ... existing code ...

  handle-build-results:
    needs: [bump-version, ios-build]  # Removed android-build from needs
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: always()

    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.PAT_GITHUB }}

      - name: Configure Git
        run: |
          git config --global user.email "github-actions[bot]@users.noreply.github.com"
          git config --global user.name "github-actions[bot]"

      - name: Handle build results
        run: |
          if [[ "${{ needs.ios-build.result }}" == "failure" ]]; then
            echo "iOS build failed, but keeping version bump for production tracking"
            echo "Failed platform: iOS"
          else
            echo "All builds succeeded!"
          fi

// ... existing code ...
```

The changes made:
1. Removed the entire `android-build` job
2. Updated the `handle-build-results` job to:
   - Remove `android-build` from the `needs` array
   - Simplify the build results check to only look for iOS build failures
   
The rest of the workflow file remains unchanged. This will effectively disable Android builds while keeping the iOS build process intact.
