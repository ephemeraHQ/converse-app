## Type Error Resolution in TypeScript Code (11/14/2024, 10:42:39 AM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string & LayoutChangeEvent & NativeSyntheticEvent<TextLayoutEventData> & GestureResponderEvent & AccessibilityActionEvent'.
  Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'LayoutChangeEvent'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error suggests that the function being passed expects multiple event types but is receiving just a string. Here's how to fix it by adding type assertions to the function call:

```typescript:components/ParsedText/ParsedText.utils.ts
// ... existing code ...
acc[key] = typeof value === "function" ? 
  (...args: any[]) => value(text as any, index) : 
  value;
// ... existing code ...
```

This fix uses type assertions to bypass the type checking since the function could be handling various event types. While using `any` isn't ideal, it's necessary here due to the dynamic nature of the pattern matching and event handling.

If you want a more type-safe solution, you'd need to modify the `ICustomParseShape` type to be more specific about the function signatures it accepts, but that would require more extensive changes to the component's type system.
