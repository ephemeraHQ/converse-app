To improve the function name, we should choose something more descriptive that reflects the purpose of the function. Since this function handles the processing and metadata storage of an attachment, a name like `processAndStoreAttachment` would be more appropriate.

Here's how you can update the function name:

```typescript:utils/attachment/handleAttachment.ts
// ... existing imports ...

export const processAndStoreAttachment = async (
  messageId: string,
  filename: string,
  mimeType: string | undefined
) => {
  // ... existing code ...
};

// Update any references to `handleAttachment` to `processAndStoreAttachment` in your codebase.
```

### Explanation
- **Function Name**: Changed from `handleAttachment` to `processAndStoreAttachment` to better describe its functionality, which involves processing the attachment and storing its metadata.
