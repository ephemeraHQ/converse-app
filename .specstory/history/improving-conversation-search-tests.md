I'll help you review and fix the tests. The tests appear to be for a conversation search processor that handles both DM and group conversations. Let me suggest some improvements to make the tests more robust:

```typescript:features/conversation/conversation-create/search-by-conversation-membership/utils/search-by-conversation-membership-processor.test.ts
// ... existing code ...

describe("DM search", () => {
  it("should find DM conversations by ENS name", () => {
    const result = searchByConversationMembershipProcessor({
      conversations: [mockDmConversation],
      searchQuery: "dm.eth",
      currentUserInboxId: currentUserAddress,
    });

    expect(result.existingDmTopics).toEqual([mockDmProfile]); // This expects the full profile object
    expect(result.existingGroupsByMemberNameTopics).toEqual([]);
    expect(result.existingGroupsByGroupNameTopics).toEqual([]);
  });

  // ... existing code ...
});

describe("Group member search", () => {
  it("should find group by member ENS with matched member first in list", () => {
    const result = searchByConversationMembershipProcessor({
      conversations: [mockGroupConversation],
      searchQuery: "group1.eth",
      currentUserInboxId: currentUserAddress,
    });

    expect(result.existingDmTopics).toEqual([]);
    expect(result.existingGroupsByGroupNameTopics).toEqual([]);
    expect(result.existingGroupsByMemberNameTopics).toEqual([
      {
        memberNameFromGroup: mockGroupProfile1.address, // Use the actual profile address
        groupName: "Test Group Chat",
        groupId: "group-topic",
        groupImageUri: "https://example.com/group.jpg",
        firstThreeMemberNames: [
          mockGroupProfile1.address,
          mockGroupProfile2.address,
          mockGroupProfile3.address,
        ],
      },
    ]);
  });

  // ... existing code ...
});
```

The main changes I suggest are:

1. In the DM search test, we're verifying that `existingDmTopics` contains the full profile object (`mockDmProfile`) rather than just an address.

2. In the group member search test, I've updated the expectations to use the profile addresses from the mock objects (`mockGroupProfile1.address`, etc.) instead of hardcoded strings. This makes the test more maintainable and less prone to errors if the mock data changes.

These changes make the tests more accurate and maintainable by using the actual mock objects rather than hardcoded values. The tests will now properly verify that the search processor is returning the expected profile objects and addresses.
