## Improving Error Message Handling (2/5/2025, 7:02:01 PM)

find better way to add to the message

_**Assistant**_

Based on the code style guide and best practices, I'll help improve the error message handling. Instead of spreading the error and overwriting the message, we should preserve the original error details while adding context. Here's the suggested change:

```typescript:components/StateHandlers/HydrationStateHandler.tsx
// ... existing code ...
              captureError({
                error,
                context: `[Hydration] Failed to get inboxId for account ${account}, removing account`,
              });
// ... existing code ...
```

This change:
1. Preserves the original error object without modification
2. Adds context about where and why the error occurred
3. Follows the pattern of not mutating error objects
4. Makes it clearer in logs what the original error was versus the contextual information

The change assumes that `captureError` accepts an object with `error` and `context` properties. If you need to modify the `captureError` utility to handle this pattern, let me know and I can help with that as well.

is there not a better way to like do new Error(..) ?

---

_**Assistant**_

Ah yes! A better approach would be to create a new error that wraps the original error while preserving the stack trace. Here's the improved version:

```typescript:components/StateHandlers/HydrationStateHandler.tsx
// ... existing code ...
              const wrappedError = new Error(
                `[Hydration] Failed to get inboxId for account ${account}, removing account: ${error.message}`
              );
              wrappedError.cause = error;
              captureError(wrappedError);
// ... existing code ...
```

This approach:
1. Creates a new error with a descriptive message
2. Uses the `cause` property to maintain the original error (supported in modern JavaScript)
3. Preserves the error chain for better debugging
4. Follows standard error handling patterns
5. Makes it clearer in logs what happened while maintaining the original error context

This is a more idiomatic way to handle error wrapping and provides better error tracking capabilities.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Function implicitly has return type 'any' because it does not have a return type annotation and is referenced directly or indirectly in one of its return expressions.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

Here's the fix by adding an explicit return type to the async function:

```typescript:components/StateHandlers/HydrationStateHandler.tsx
// ... existing code ...
          accounts.map(async (account): Promise<void> => {
            try {
              await ensureInboxId({ account });
// ... existing code ...
```

This explicitly specifies that the async function returns a Promise<void>, resolving the TypeScript error.
