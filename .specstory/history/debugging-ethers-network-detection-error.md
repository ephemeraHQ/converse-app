## Debugging Ethers Network Detection Error (2/6/2025, 2:30:05 PM)

_**User**_

which lib could give error like "could not detect network (event="noNetwork"" ???

---

_**Assistant**_

This error typically comes from `ethers` library when it cannot connect to an Ethereum network. This usually happens when:

1. There's no internet connection
2. The RPC URL is incorrect or not responding
3. There are issues with the network configuration

The error message "could not detect network (event="noNetwork")" is specifically from ethers v5 or v6. Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure you have proper network connectivity
2. Verify your RPC endpoint is correct and accessible
3. Check if you're properly importing and configuring ethers polyfills

Looking at your polyfills.ts file, you already have the necessary ethers-related polyfills:

```typescript:polyfills.ts
// ... existing code ...
import "@walletconnect/react-native-compat";
import "react-native-get-random-values"; // Privy requires this
import "@ethersproject/shims"; // Privy requires this
// ... existing code ...
```

If you're still getting this error, you might want to:

1. Check your network provider configuration where you initialize ethers
2. Make sure you're handling network state properly
3. Consider adding error boundaries around ethers-dependent components
4. Add proper error logging to track when and where this occurs

Would you like me to help you with any specific part of the implementation or error handling?

look in my package.json

_**Assistant**_

I don't see your full package.json content - only a single line showing the postinstall script:

```json:package.json
    "postinstall": "patch-package && husky install && cross-os postinstall"
```

To help identify which library might be causing the "could not detect network" error, I'd need to see your package.json dependencies. Could you please share the `dependencies` and `devDependencies` sections of your package.json? This would help me identify which Ethereum-related libraries you're using (like ethers, web3.js, WalletConnect, etc.) and their versions.
