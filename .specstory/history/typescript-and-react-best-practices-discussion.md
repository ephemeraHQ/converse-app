## TypeScript and React Best Practices Discussion (1/9/2025, 2:25:25 PM)

does it makes sense?

_**Assistant**_

Yes, these code style guidelines make sense and follow many modern best practices for TypeScript and React development. Let me highlight some key points that are particularly well thought out:

1. **Component Organization**
   - Putting the exported component at the top of the file makes it easy to find the main entry point
   - Keeping related components close to the main component improves code readability and maintainability

2. **TypeScript Practices**
   - Avoiding `any` and preferring strong typing
   - Using type assertions with `satisfies` is a good modern practice that provides better type safety
   - Preferring types over interfaces with clear naming conventions (IMyItem)

3. **Function Patterns**
   - Using object parameters improves readability and makes it easier to add new parameters later
   - Destructuring arguments is a clean pattern that makes it clear which properties are being used

4. **React Best Practices**
   - Minimizing useEffect and setState usage helps reduce complexity
   - Using memo() for performance optimization
   - Preferring early returns over ternaries improves readability

5. **Project Structure**
   - Consistent naming conventions for directories and files
   - Clear import path standards with @/ prefix
   - Organized theming system with a central theme provider

The only potential point that might need clarification is the duplicate line:
```cursorrules
- Prefer clean, readable code over compact code.
```
This appears twice in the Core Principles section and could be consolidated into a single entry.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Type '((progressAnimatedValue: SharedValue<number>, dragAnimatedValue: SharedValue<number>, swipeable: SwipeableMethods) => ReactNode) | undefined' does not satisfy the constraint '(...args: any) => any'.
  Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type '(...args: any) => any'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because `Parameters` utility type requires a function type, but `SwipeableProps["renderLeftActions"]` can be `undefined`. Here's the fix:

```typescript:components/swipeable.tsx
export type ISwipeableRenderActionsArgs = NonNullable<SwipeableProps["renderLeftActions"]> extends (...args: infer P) => any ? P[0] : never;
```

This fix:
1. Uses `NonNullable` to remove `undefined`
2. Uses conditional type with `infer` to extract the parameters
3. Takes the first parameter with `P[0]`
