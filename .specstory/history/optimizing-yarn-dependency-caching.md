## Optimizing Yarn Dependency Caching (1/27/2025, 11:33:35 AM)

how can i make sure yarn install isn't run every time if like yarn.lock hasn't changed? I want to cache those deps...

_**Assistant**_

I can help you optimize the yarn dependencies caching. The key is to properly cache the node_modules directory and ensure we're using the yarn.lock file for cache validation. Here's how to modify the workflow:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
// ... existing code ...
      - name: Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: .nvmrc
          cache: "yarn"
          cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock
        env:
          SKIP_YARN_COREPACK_CHECK: "1"
      - run: corepack enable

      - name: Get yarn cache directory path
        id: yarn-cache-dir-path
        run: echo "dir=$(yarn config get cacheFolder)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Cache yarn dependencies
        uses: actions/cache@v3
        id: yarn-cache
        with:
          path: |
            **/node_modules
            ${{ steps.yarn-cache-dir-path.outputs.dir }}
          key: ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-${{ hashFiles('**/yarn.lock') }}
          restore-keys: |
            ${{ runner.os }}-yarn-

      - name: Install dependencies
        if: steps.yarn-cache.outputs.cache-hit != 'true'
        run: yarn install --frozen-lockfile
// ... existing code ...
```

Key changes made:
1. Added `cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock` to the setup-node step to ensure proper cache invalidation
2. Added steps to get and cache the yarn cache directory
3. Added caching for both node_modules and yarn's cache directory
4. Made yarn install conditional based on cache hit
5. Added `--frozen-lockfile` to yarn install to ensure consistency

This setup will:
- Cache dependencies based on the hash of yarn.lock
- Only run yarn install when there's no cache hit
- Speed up your workflow by reusing cached dependencies when possible

is there a cleaner way?

_**Assistant**_

Yes! The `actions/setup-node` action with `cache: "yarn"` actually handles most of this for us already. We just need to ensure we're using the cache-dependency-path correctly. Here's the simpler solution:

```yaml:.github/workflows/deploy-preview.yml
// ... existing code ...
      - name: Setup node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version-file: .nvmrc
          cache: "yarn"
          cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock
        env:
          SKIP_YARN_COREPACK_CHECK: "1"
      - run: corepack enable

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: yarn install --immutable
// ... existing code ...
```

Key changes:
1. Kept the `cache-dependency-path: yarn.lock` to ensure proper cache invalidation
2. Changed to `--immutable` flag (modern equivalent of `--frozen-lockfile`)
3. Removed the manual caching steps since `actions/setup-node` handles this automatically

This is much cleaner and will still provide the same caching benefits! The `actions/setup-node` action automatically handles caching of both the Yarn cache and node_modules when you specify `cache: "yarn"`.

what does immuatable does

---

_**Assistant**_



`--immutable` is a Yarn 2+ (Berry) flag that ensures your dependencies remain exactly as specified in your yarn.lock file. Here's what it does:

1. Verifies that yarn.lock is not modified during install
2. Fails if there are any inconsistencies between package.json and yarn.lock
3. Prevents auto-fixing of dependencies
4. Ensures reproducible installations across different environments

It's essentially a stricter version of the old `--frozen-lockfile` flag from Yarn 1, making it perfect for CI environments where you want to ensure:
- No accidental dependency updates
- Exact version matching
- Build reproducibility
- Failed builds if lock file needs updating

Example scenarios where `--immutable` will fail the install:
- If yarn.lock is missing
- If yarn.lock doesn't match package.json
- If someone forgot to commit changes to yarn.lock after adding/updating dependencies

Without `--immutable`, Yarn might silently update dependencies, which could lead to inconsistent builds across different environments.
