## Improving Function Naming for Clarity (1/28/2025, 2:52:53 PM)

is this a good name?

Based on the code style guide and looking at what the function actually does, we could improve the name to be more descriptive and clear about its purpose.

The current name `setupTopicNotificationsSubscriptions` is a bit ambiguous and doesn't fully convey that it:
1. Sets up subscription listeners for account changes
2. Manages topic notification subscriptions for multiple accounts
3. Handles both initial setup and ongoing account additions/removals

Here are some better alternatives:

1. `setupAccountsNotificationSubscriptionManager` - This better reflects that it's managing subscriptions at the accounts level
2. `initializeAccountsNotificationSystem` - This emphasizes its role as an initialization function
3. `setupMultiAccountNotificationSubscriptions` - This clearly indicates it handles multiple accounts

I would recommend renaming it to `setupAccountsNotificationSubscriptionManager` as it best describes the function's responsibility of managing notification subscriptions across multiple accounts. Here's how you would update it:

```typescript:features/notifications/utils/accountTopicSubscription.ts
// ... existing code ...
export function setupAccountsNotificationSubscriptionManager() {
    // ... existing code ...
}
// ... existing code ...
```

This name better follows the style guide's principle of using descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose, even if they end up being longer.
