where in here does it returns string

_**Assistant**_

In the `content` method of the `DecodedMessage` class, the return type is defined as `ExtractDecodedType<[...ContentTypes, TextCodec][number] | string>`. This means that the method can return either a decoded type from the content types or a string.

However, in the provided code snippet, there is no explicit return statement that returns a `string`. The method primarily returns the result of `codec.decode(encoded)` or `codec.decode(this.nativeContent)`, which are expected to return a type that matches `ExtractDecodedType<[...ContentTypes, TextCodec][number]>`.

The `| string` part of the return type suggests that there might be scenarios outside of this snippet where a string could be returned, possibly due to the implementation of the `decode` method in the codecs. If the `decode` method in any of the codecs returns a string, then this method would return a string. However, based on the provided code, it does not directly return a string.
