## TypeScript Error Resolution: Unknown to String Array (11/25/2024, 12:16:13 PM)

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Type 'unknown' is not assignable to type 'string[]'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error you're encountering is due to TypeScript's `JSON.parse` returning a value of type `unknown`. To resolve this, you can explicitly cast the parsed value to a `string[]`. Here's how you can update the code:

```typescript:utils/emojis/favoritedEmojis.ts
    if (savedEmojis) {
      this.emojis = JSON.parse(savedEmojis) as string[];
    } else {
      this.emojis = DEFAULT_EMOJIS;
```

### Explanation
- **Type Assertion**: By using `as string[]`, you inform TypeScript that you expect the result of `JSON.parse(savedEmojis)` to be an array of strings. This resolves the type error by explicitly defining the expected type.
