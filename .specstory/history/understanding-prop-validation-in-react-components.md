## Understanding Prop Validation in React Components (11/7/2024, 8:31:40 AM)

'onDismiss' is missing in props validation what is prop validation?

_**Assistant**_

Prop validation refers to defining and checking the types of props that a component can receive. In TypeScript with React, this is typically done through the component's props interface/type definition.

In your case, the `onDismiss` prop is being used in the `Banner` component but it's not included in the `AnimatedBannerProps` interface. Here's how to fix it:

```typescript:components/Banner/AnimatedBanner.tsx
// ... existing code ...

type IAnimatedBannerProps = {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  cta?: string;
  onButtonPress?: () => void;
  onDismiss?: () => void;  // Added this line
  style?: StyleProp<ViewStyle>;
  onLayout?: (event: LayoutChangeEvent) => void;  // Also adding onLayout since it's passed to Banner
};

// ... rest of the code ...
```

I've made a few changes:
1. Changed `interface` to `type` and prefixed with 'I' per your conventions
2. Added the missing `onDismiss` prop definition
3. Added `onLayout` prop since it's also being passed to the Banner component
4. Used type instead of interface per your preferences

This ensures type safety by explicitly defining all props that can be passed to the component.

but on dismiss was alraedyt in the type???

_**Assistant**_

I apologize for my mistake! You're absolutely right - looking at the code again, `onDismiss` is already included in the `AnimatedBannerProps` interface:

```typescript:components/Banner/AnimatedBanner.tsx
interface AnimatedBannerProps {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  cta?: string;
  onButtonPress?: () => void;
  onDismiss?: () => void;  // It's already here!
  style?: StyleProp<ViewStyle>;
}
```

I made an error in my review. The prop validation is actually correct, and `onDismiss` is properly typed. I apologize for any confusion this may have caused!

so why here i have the error "'onDismiss' is missing in props validation"

Ah, I understand the confusion now! The error is likely coming from the `Banner` component, not the `AnimatedBanner` component. When you spread the props and add additional props to the `Banner` component here:

```typescript:components/Banner/AnimatedBanner.tsx
<Banner {...props} onDismiss={handleDismiss} onLayout={handleLayout} />
```

The error suggests that the `Banner` component's props type definition (which we can't see in this file) doesn't include `onDismiss` in its prop validation. 

To fix this, you would need to update the prop types in the `Banner.tsx` file. It should look something like this:

```typescript:components/Banner/Banner.tsx
type IBannerProps = {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  cta?: string;
  onButtonPress?: () => void;
  onDismiss?: () => void;  // Add this line in Banner.tsx
  onLayout?: (event: LayoutChangeEvent) => void;
  // ... any other props
};
```

The error is telling you that while you're passing `onDismiss` to the `Banner` component, the `Banner` component itself doesn't have this prop defined in its type definition.

no fuck it's there. Explain me the missing prop validation thing

Ah, now I understand what you're asking about! 

"Props validation" can refer to two different things in React:

1. **Type Validation** (TypeScript) - what we already have with the interface/type definitions
2. **Runtime Validation** (PropTypes) - an additional validation layer that checks props during development

Even though we have TypeScript types defined, some linting rules (especially ones for React) might expect runtime prop validation using `PropTypes`. This was more common in older React code and with JavaScript, but some people still use it with TypeScript for extra safety.

Here's what runtime validation would look like:

```typescript:components/Banner/AnimatedBanner.tsx
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';

// ... your existing code ...

AnimatedBanner.propTypes = {
  title: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  description: PropTypes.string.isRequired,
  cta: PropTypes.string,
  onButtonPress: PropTypes.func,
  onDismiss: PropTypes.func,
  style: PropTypes.object
};
```

However, with TypeScript, this is generally considered redundant because:
1. TypeScript already provides compile-time type checking
2. PropTypes only run in development and add bundle size
3. TypeScript's type system is more powerful than PropTypes

If you're seeing this error, it's likely from a linting rule that you can safely disable or reconfigure since you're using TypeScript.

But I DON'T want propType !! Since i'm using typescript

_**Assistant**_



Exactly! You're absolutely right. Since you're using TypeScript, you don't need or want PropTypes - it would be redundant and add unnecessary code.

If you're seeing the error "'onDismiss' is missing in props validation", it's likely coming from an ESLint rule (probably `react/prop-types`) that's configured to expect PropTypes even though you're using TypeScript.

You can fix this by either:

1. Disabling the rule in your `.eslintrc` file:
```json
{
  "rules": {
    "react/prop-types": "off"
  }
}
```

2. Or adding a disable comment above your component if you only want to disable it for this file:
```typescript:components/Banner/AnimatedBanner.tsx
/* eslint-disable react/prop-types */
const AnimatedBanner: React.FC<AnimatedBannerProps> = React.memo((props) => {
  // ... your code ...
});
```

The first approach (disabling in `.eslintrc`) is better since you're using TypeScript throughout your project and don't need PropTypes validation anywhere.
