Delete all the state here but keep the sekletcon. WE'll add stuff later

I'll help you simplify the settings store by removing all the state while keeping the basic structure. Here's the modified version:

```typescript:data/store/settingsStore.ts
import { create } from "zustand";
import { createJSONStorage, persist } from "zustand/middleware";
import { zustandMMKVStorage } from "../../utils/mmkv";

export type SettingsStoreType = {
  // We'll add state properties here later
};

export const initSettingsStore = (account: string) => {
  const settingsStore = create<SettingsStoreType>()(
    persist(
      (set) => ({
        // We'll add state and actions here later
      }),
      {
        name: `store-${account}-settings`, // Account-based storage so each account can have its own settings
        storage: createJSONStorage(() => zustandMMKVStorage),
        version: 1,
      }
    )
  );
  return settingsStore;
};
```

I've:
1. Kept the core imports and store initialization structure
2. Removed all state properties and their setters from `SettingsStoreType`
3. Removed all state initialization and setter functions from the store creation
4. Kept the persist middleware configuration but removed the migrate function since we're starting fresh
5. Maintained the account-based storage naming convention

The store is now ready to have new state added to it as needed.
