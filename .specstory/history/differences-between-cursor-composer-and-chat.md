what is difference between Cursor composer and Chat

_**Assistant**_

I don't see any code or context related to Cursor composer or Chat in the file you shared. The file you provided is `app.config.ts` which appears to be an Expo configuration file containing various settings for different environments (development, preview, and production) of what seems to be a React Native application.

Could you please provide more context about the Cursor composer and Chat components you're asking about? That way I can better explain the differences between them.
