## React Native Parse Error Troubleshooting (11/7/2024, 8:38:46 AM)

Parse errors in imported module 'react-native/Libraries/Components/View/ReactNativeStyleAttributes': parser.parse is not a function (undefined:undefined)  import/namespace

_**Assistant**_

This error typically occurs because of compatibility issues with the ReactNativeStyleAttributes import. Let's modify the polyfills file to use a different approach for adding the scaleY style attribute.

Here's how to fix it:

```typescript:polyfills.ts
// ... existing imports ...

// Replace the problematic import and direct assignment with:
if (global.ReactNativeStyleAttributes?.View) {
  global.ReactNativeStyleAttributes.View.scaleY = true;
}

// ... rest of the file ...
```

This change:
1. Removes the direct import of ReactNativeStyleAttributes which is causing the parse error
2. Safely accesses the global ReactNativeStyleAttributes object
3. Adds the scaleY property only if the View styles exist

This approach is more resilient as it:
- Avoids direct imports from React Native internal libraries which can be unstable
- Uses a safer way to modify the style attributes through the global object
- Includes a null check to prevent runtime errors

If you still need the scaleY functionality and this doesn't work, you might need to consider adding the transform property directly in your components instead.
